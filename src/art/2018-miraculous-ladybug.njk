<p>Ladybug and Chat Noir! Monochrome comic style.</p>
<p>
  I wanted to do a little experiment with digital vs analog inking! The analog versions can be found on my Instagram.
</p>

  Just a stress-relief doodle, tbh!
  <br>
  Next time Iâ€™d like to improve on hair <em>and the darned stabilizer</em>, because it is either too fast, or too slow, for hatching. Gotta find the sweet spot.
