<p>My friendâ€™s-friend was doing a #DrawYourDrink thing, and I thought I could try! Iâ€™m quite late.</p>
<p>
  I wanted to go for the vibe of, someone who looks a Hot Topic worker, but is actually a Sanrio worker, lol. She looks more like her tea leaves and bits of fruit, but is actually quite sweet. ðŸ’•
</p>

  I wanna practice cel-shading more. I feel like I take too long to finish anything: but if I can flat shade in a way thatâ€™s visually appealing, Iâ€™ll be able to upload art on a more consistent basis, I think. Additionally: I need to improve my coloring (color choices).
</p>
<p>Mhmm! Anyways, I quite love this design. I might make this a character in one of my other stories.</p>
