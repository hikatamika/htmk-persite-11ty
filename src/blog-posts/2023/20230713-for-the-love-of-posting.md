## Dead Bird

It’s weird watching people more or less beg and plead for Twitter to continue being the Internet's public square despite Elon being ableist, a transphobe and a COVID-denier, and ruining Twitter since its purchase of it (like, hello? The removal of being able to receive DMs from non-mutuals is just the tip of the iceberg). The main reasons for “This-Is-Fine”-dog-ing tend to be:

1. Twitter’s one of the few NSFW-friendly sites. (Go to [Pixiv](https://www.pixiv.net/en/) or [CoHost](https://cohost.org/). Or [ask me to put you on my BlueSky invite waitlist](https://hikatamika.com/contact/).)
2. A lot of creators’ existing audiences are on Twitter, and they like being able to post to one place with a ton of reach. [(Though that reach has been rapidly tanking.)](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/10/twitter-traffic-is-nosediving-as-metas-threads-hits-100-million-users.html)

What’s even more odd is seeing artists big and small try to shame, clown, and dunk other sites in attempts to prevent their audience from leaving. It’s okay to be fed up and draw a line in the sand. The real issue is certain artists choosing to put all their eggs in one basket and refusing to diversify despite the growing elephant in the room (understandably, diversifying one’s online presence is not easy).

## Spread Your Wings, I Guess?

Crosspost! Crosspost, crosspost, crosspost! At any moment, a site could disappear! The site can fall victim to [enshittification](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/enshittification)! The algorithm could turn to garbage! The CEO can turn out to be a ‘phobe! At literally any moment! Your connection to your audience shouldn’t live or die on one site.

I currently use [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) and [PostyBirb](https://www.postybirb.com/) to crosspost: Buffer for the “big” social media places, and PostyBirb for the art sites and sites with API tools more accessible to the developer. I write my captions and hashtags locally using LibreOffice Writer and simply paste them into Buffer and PB per post.

Artists that have web-stores or take commissions: consider having your repeat customers subscribe to mailing lists so they’re always in the loop. (No advice for good mailing list platforms cause I currently don’t need ‘em.)

## Connections over Numbers

My advice for _existing_ on social media is to think of the 1-3 sites you find most enjoyable to scroll on and genuinely interact with other people’s work. Let them know what aspects of their work you find awesome (this can also be a good way to find things you want to improve on). Give likes, and if you can afford to share their work without making your own profile page messy, do so! But, make sure you’re doing it with the goal of just-plain-being-nice and hopefully brightening someone’s day, lest your brain become poisoned by… _**The Numbers…**_

## The Numbers

The numbers suck. They’re what make execs enshittify websites and what kill the spirits of creatives. Most importantly, they’re the gears in every site with an algorithm.

It’s like this: execs and shareholders (of the big-name sites, this doesn’t apply to indie-socmed like Mastodon,) want people to stay and scroll through their ads for longer. They figure they’re able to do this by showing you content they think you’ll want to see in-between, and the content they think you want to see is the stuff that already has thousands, millions, and billions of likes from people with thousands, millions, and billions of followers, and that’s why discovery on most algorithm-driven sites is garbage.

Ironically enough, I like social media for the connection, and would sit through more ads if it meant I could interact and form allyships with artists of my skill level and follower count.

## What Now?

And yeah. Those are just my thoughts, as it stands, I guess. Elon bought Twitter in like, November of `22, but the snowball that is the SocMed-pocalypse feels like it’s rolling at its fastest right now.

IDK what happens next, and that’s [why you can find me most anywhere @HikaTamika](https://hikatamika.com/links/). It’s also why you can find me, right here on this website.
