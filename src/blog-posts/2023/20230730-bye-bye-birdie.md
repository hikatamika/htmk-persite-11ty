It's with a heavy heart that I uhhâ€¦ sort of tentatively retire [my Twitter account](https://twitter.com/HikaTamika). Why?

- [Elon's dedicated to feeding all Tweets and media into his new genAI machine.](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/elon-musk-plans-tesla-twitter-collaborations-with-xai.html?s=09) (Yes I [Glaze](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/) my art, but I still Don't Like That.)
- Cap on DMs for free users, DMs limited to paying Twitter Subscribers by default. (Impacting future communications.)
- "Cisgender", a totally neutral gender categorization, is officially considered a "slur" as per Elon's rules.

It's just hostile towards me as a queer artist.

My initial plan was to use embeds from my [Instagram](https://instagram.com/HikaTamika), [Mastodon](http://mastodon.art/@HikaTamika), and even my [Threads](https://threads.net/@hikatamika) account to share media with Twitter, but tools like [Zapier](https://zapier.com/) and [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) require premium subscriptions to be able to automate Twitter in order to pay Elon's API fees. I don't feel like investing money in Twitter even indirectly.

So, unless anyone has any better ideas (on how to automate sharing media to Twitter without uploading directly), it's been a good run! I've been on Twitter in some form since ~2010 as a member of the English-speaking VocalSynth community. In its earliest days it felt really social; almost like a chat room, and we'd all have secondary accounts we'd hop onto after reaching our Twitter rate limits from simply chatting on there.

Since Elon's July blunders, my engagement on my art posts has been dwindling, so it doesn't feel like too much of a loss. Nothing feels worth being a part of xAI, even if I'm poisoning the well a bit. I'm a small account on all of my platforms anyway, but it still feels like the end of a **_long-time_** era for me. I've made a lot of friends on Twitter.
