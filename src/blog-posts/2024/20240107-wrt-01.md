Hello! Happy New Year! I low-key doubt that most people interested in me read self-hosted Internet blogs, but I love to journal, and if I‚Äôm paying for this place I might as well use it as an outlet for my thoughts on social media and my art.

## Art Round-Up

This past week I finished and uploaded the final DTIYS prize I needed to do for my winners! In this case, the prize is for [JimWhaleyArt](https://www.instagram.com/jimwhaleyart/) who responded to [the prompt](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxaismfsJpW/) with [a cool digital collage of Lux Pink](https://www.instagram.com/p/CxlEhAwONqK/)! It was such a unique entry that I needed to recognize it somehow.

For the short video platforms, I was running behind on the process video for another one of the DTIYS prizes, so I used an IG reels trend. A simple [2022 vs 2023 art video](https://youtube.com/shorts/U1dHr4KRchY). What caught me off guard and made me laugh was that two people responded to my comment question of ‚ÄúDid I improve?‚Äù with like, ‚ÄúThese look the same/I don‚Äôt see any improvement‚Äù. üòÇ

To be fair to them‚Ä¶! They were two illustrations of Amity/LUX:Pink.

## Art Progress

Recently I‚Äôve come up with a method/setup/process for drawing backgrounds that I really enjoy. I‚Äôd like to share more of that with you through video, but I feel like I need some things to make my videos more interesting, what with the global decreasing attention span. (My retention graphs on video platforms are scarily bad, tbh.) I‚Äôm recording the process though, so y‚Äôall‚Äôll see _something eventually._ For now, I‚Äôm tossing a [WIP shot to the Dwarf-Star Ko-Fi tier](https://ko-fi.com/i/IL3L3T37DE).

I‚Äôve saved enough money to commission a 3D Vtuber and get a LeapMotion controller, which‚Äôll help add‚Ä¶ ‚Äúface-factor‚Äù to my videos. (I feel like people appreciate the feeling like they‚Äôre interacting with _someone_ and not just a machine.) I just need to finish inking and coloring the reference sheet. I guess I‚Äôll be posting [WIPs of that too](https://ko-fi.com/i/IU7U5T37E3).

## Art Thoughts

This year is a bit of a shake-up for me. I‚Äôm dealing with IRL‚Ä¶ grief(?) loss(?), by trying to stay busy and not a boo-hoo-baby about it. My current day job is quite seasonal, and now that I‚Äôm out of the ‚ò†Ô∏è Busy Quarter ‚ò†Ô∏è, I‚Äôve been bringing my laptop and pen display to work for when I‚Äôm ahead of everything and no one needs me.

Tangential to the feelings both grief and day jobs bring, this year I‚Äôm accepting that the algorithms of all these different platforms in the Social Media Apocalypse are things that I can‚Äôt control, so I‚Äôm focusing on them less. What I can focus on/control, is the effort I put into improving my skills, and just trying to be a nice, friendly, and engaging person online.

These are like, the baby steps to both having the skills to make a webcomic that people‚Äôd like to read, and the financial support to dedicate more hours of my week towards it. Mhm.

But yeah, that‚Äôs all for the past week! I have fun uploads going out this week, so be sure to follow me on [all your favorite internet websites](https://hikatamika.com/links), and/or consider [peeping my Ko-Fi tiers](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers) for uncut, behind-the-scenes looks at my process (plugging feels so weird with how small I am, I‚Äôm sorry).

And, uhhh consider adding [this blog‚Äôs RSS feed](https://hikatamika.com/feed/) to your feed reader if you‚Äôd like to keep up with me? I am _**not**_ making this a newsletter, bro, like, unless I‚Äôm applying to jobs I feel like even _**I**_ don‚Äôt check my emails enough for that to be a good idea. But as a webcomic guy, I check my RSS feeds _**daily**_, lol.
