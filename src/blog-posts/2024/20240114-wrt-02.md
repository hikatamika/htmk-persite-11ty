Hi-hi everyone. Y'all hanging in thereâ€¦? Personally I feel like... I'm working a lot but that it's still not enoughâ€¦ Hrmmâ€¦ Anyway.

## Art Roundup

This week's art post was my first drawing of the year; my good friend Demorrtis' OC Harun. I had a ton of fun with this doodleâ€¦ and it's weird to acknowledge in myself, but I think I'm becoming like... _okay_ at digital manga-style art.

This week's art post was _also_ this week's short video. I feel like, for now, my short videos kind of just _are_ what they _**are**_, y'feel me? I'll get into why in this week's Art Thoughts, but now it's time forâ€¦

## Art Progress

So, something kinda funny and rather spontaneous started this week. One of my friends put on all three DreamWorks Trolls movies for us to watch. And though, this year I resolved to not draw fanart just 'cause I "feel like I should", I somehow got fanart _adjacent_ brainworms for the first time in what feels like years. _Specifically,_ I wanted to shove two of _my OCs_ into a Dreamworks Trolls AUâ€¦ _**with a two-page comic**_.

So this week I've been thumbing, sketching, and inking that. IDK what a normal comic-making pace is, but I'm at least faster at this than I expected to be? Maybe it can be... not this upcoming week's art post, but the one after's??? Or after-after's??? Who knows. I still have to convert the thing to scroll format after I finish. I'll be saving the page version for Ko-Fi supporters and compilation zines. I also have to make the logo and branding for the short-story collection it'll belong to.

I miss when I could just finish things and post them without any windup or eventual fanfare, but now I feel like I _have_ to in order for my posts to stand out when they _**are**_ ready. Sigh, lol.ðŸ˜”

About that short-story collection!! I'll be calling it Astraâ˜…Mix Minis, and it'll just be like, what writers call _vignettes_, but as comics. I refer to this concept as _**microcomics**_; 1-4 page scenes and snippets of my OCs in AUs and prompts. For fun, for my portfolio, and to get both my skill _up_ and the ugly _**out**_. I do _**NOT**_ wanna be making LuxNox or Somnius only to find myself in an endless loop of wanting to burn Chapter 01 and redraw it.

...

Demi-Human Diaries tho, (with Hevel & friends,) that one can be ugly if it needs to be, I'm less hung up about that one.

Anyway,

## Art Thoughts

This week I've been thinking about short video a lot. When I browse short video platforms, especially TikTok, for how I should be putting myself out there as an artist, I feel like the stuff that's really well-received and goes viral is art content imagined, made, and formatted as a short, vertical, video. Relatable art skits, animatics, and even full animations in 9:16 ratio.

This is a bit of a problem for me as someone trying to be a webcomic artist. Because, if I dedicate time and effort to making the stuff that does well on TikTok; the skits, animatics, and animationsâ€¦

_**That's less time and effort I have left over to try and become a webcomic artist, y'feel me?**_

So what I'm trying to do right now, especially with a day job that already takes a chunk of time, is to make short video content from the projects I'm already prioritizing. Comics and illustrations. The result is... cut/edited art process videos. But, I think that content might not be very entertaining and sharable compared to skits and the like.

And I ain't got a solution, just a dilemma. Oh well.

Welp! Yup, yup! That's all for this week's Weekly Roundup Thing. Don't forget to [add me to your feed reader](https://hikatamika.com/feed/) and [follow me around on all the websites and stuff](https://hikatamika.com/links/). I'll see yaaaaaâ€¦ next week!
