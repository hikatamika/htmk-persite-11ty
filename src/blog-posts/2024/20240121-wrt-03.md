(Slightly weary voice) Hellooooo! Happy Sundayyyy...!! Happy... Weekly Roundup Thing No.3!!

This week has been both like... really cool in the sense that I feel like I'm really close to a lot of stuff I want to do, but also kind of like, _"aw, **man...**"_ in that I feel like the things I have planned for this year and my future still feel really far away. Ah well.

First up!!

## Art Roundup

![My hand drawing on my pen display. I‚Äôm inking a comic.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\SocMed%20Wips\2024\20240114_AmleyWIP%20IG%201080.png)

This week I posted a cropped WIP shot of the My-OCs-in-a-Trolls-AU comic, promoting the full WIP being available to Ko-Fi Dwarf Stars‚Ä¶

_Like a **Goofball!!**_

On one hand, I feel like kind of a dweeb for having Ko-Fi content and trying to promote it... especially as a 300-follower-Andy. But, what I want to avoid is the situation where someone who used to post all sorts of content for free all of a sudden starts _"locking stuff behind a paywall"_ once they get enough of a follower-base, y'feelme? üò≠

I didn't really have a **_new_**-new art short this week, for a few reasons, despite recording a lot of footage, so I used my backup short: _an ugly-sketch reveal based on last week's art post,_ _**which people seemed to vastly prefer to the edited timelapse.**_ (Especially on Reels and Shorts. Both the timelapse and the art reveal flopped on TikTok tbh.) The timelapse from last week barely scratched 1-2 hundred. _The art reveal?_ **1-2 _thousand_.**

I'm‚Ä¶ now convinced that potential fans of my work don't want to see timelapses. I believe existing enjoyers of my work wouldn't mind sitting through a short timelapse from me, but, I think most short video platform users want to be entertained, and my time-lapses don't entertain them; even when I cut them up and edit them‚Ä¶ so yeah.

I can see why art reveals could be more gratifying and entertaining for people so I'll do more research into how to make those fun and cool until I get my VTuber ref sheet accepted by a 3D modeler and I can _**finally**_ start doing talking-head content.

Speaking of:

## Art Progress

I finished, _**all**_ the reference material for the 3d VTuber model I want to have made.

That was:

- _**Five**_ layers of turnarounds,
- _**Twenty-Seven**_ face-movement refs,
- One _**four**_-pic prop ref,
- _**Two**_ vector images for logo textures,
- _**One**_ palette & materials ref (I'm WindWaker simple, ok),
- And _**five**_ extra doodles.

'twas a _whole, hecking, **lot,**_ y'all. And, I felt so thrilled upon finishing, lol. I was surprised and ecstatic when the modeler I wanted most opened up their waitlist again.

_**And now I'm sitting around refreshing the requests page to see if/when I get accepted or denied.**_ I hope that _one_ of those outcomes happens this week, so I know whether to exhale or start considering another modeler.

I have... so much planned. In-depth process videos, tutorials, guides, and even some fun and easy-to-make shorts, but I know my voice and art aren't enough to stop people from scrolling away, so, just (hopefully ü§û) knowing that I have a VTuber in a modeler's oven will be a LOT of weight off my shoulders.

_**Anyway,**_ the final clothed turnaround will be this week's art post. But not its video post!! Cause!! People won't listen to me blab about how I made it if I don't have a Me of some sort on the screen, and üëèI üëèdon't üëèwanna üëèdraw üëètalksprites. I wanna draw _**comics**_. This week's video post will be a 4-piece art reveal featuring some of my 2023 hits, instead. Cause y'all love those.

Nearly done with the Trolls AU comic!! Just gotta ink two more panels, and then tone the whole thing. But before I upload it to platforms and junk, I wanna make a logo and "cover art" for the micro-comic series that it'll belong to. Maybe those'll be the week after's post and the comic itself can be the week-after-after.

Whole lotta wind-up, innit? Thanks for listening to me _**whine**_-up, lol. See ya next week!!
