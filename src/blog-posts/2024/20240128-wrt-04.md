(With my head in my hands:) Bro the way I was nose-deep in work when I realized, _"Yeah, I should prolly write this week's Weekly Roundup Thing..."_

Hi! _I'm on the verge of cool things, I **swear**!!_

## Art Roundup

![Vtuber ref sheet: an alien character](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240117_VTuberSocMed_96_gwm.png)

This week I shared the combined-layer version of my VTuber ref sheet with everyone!! My m8s and some VTubers seemed to like itâ€¦ said the design was cool, etcâ€¦ But, at the end of the day this is an orthographic, t-posed, ref sheet, and those are kinda boring. The final thing is gonna be way more impressive than that. _Speaking of, **a modeler got back to me!! And accepted my commission request!**_ So... This thing is in the kitchen!! Yippee! Excited toâ€¦ record YouTube & TikTok/Shorts/Reels videos with it!! And hopefully, stream too...

I just don't know when I'd _stream_ cause I feel like I go to work, come home, work more (art), and then sleep. ðŸ˜­ðŸ’§ If y'all don't mind focus streams where I'm not constantly checking up on chat, I could do those. Maybe I should become an energy drink person.

This week's short video was a 4-piece ugly sketch reveal that performed well on The Big Three, but skyrocketed (for me,) on YouTube Shorts: **6.4k views and 582 likes**.

So, _uh,_ _**the hypothesis is proving correct:**_ non-artists & non-followers like art reveals and dislike sitting through timelapses (even short ones)! The problem is... IDRK how to art revealâ€¦ the VTuber ref sheet, or the comic I just finished.

_**Oh yeah, the comic I just finished!!**_

## Art Progress

_**So I finished the My-Magical-Girls-in-DreamWorks-Trolls-AU comic!!**_

I spent this week wrapping up on that and reformatting the page-format manuscript (all comic manuscripts should be page-format just in case, IMO) to scroll-format. _**All that is done!!**_ I just... don't want to post it to NamiComi, GlobalComix, Tapas, and Webtoon _**until**_ I have a logo and cover (series thumbnail) for the micro-comic series it'll belong to, _Astra*Mix Minis_, and an episode header & footer I can reuse.

So I guess this week I'll be working on those final things. Heck, I was working on the logo before writing this week's blog post. I have a backup short-vid I can post this upcoming week, but I doubt its effectiveness as it's not a timelapse. I canâ€¦ share the VTuber facial expression refs with y'all for this week's image. _**I guess?!?**_ Another thing where I know it's art I drew, but I doubt its effectiveness as a post. Oh well.

## Art Thoughts

This week I've just been likeâ€¦ so in love with working on that micro-comic that I wish I could make at least half of a living making comics from the comfort of my home, and the other half working remotely in the comics industry helping bring other people's comics either to _life,_ or to the English speaking market (if you catch my drift ðŸ‘€).

But to do the _first_ thing I have to make work people think is worth supporting on Ko-Fi. Which is entirely subjective, so I can't assess how far away I am from that goal. To do the _second_ thing I just gotta bulk up my portfolio a bit more. Now _**that,**_ I have a better idea of where I'm at.

And yeah, that's where my head's at right now. I doubt my YouTube audience reads this blog but I'm really grateful to everyone who subscribed from the art reveals! I hope they'll stick around when I start using my _**voice**_ to ramble about comics instead of just my keyboard.
