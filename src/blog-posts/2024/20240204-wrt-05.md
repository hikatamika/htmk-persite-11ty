I recognize... that it's time for another... _**WEEKLY ROUNDUP THIIIIIINNGGG**_!!! Phew-ee, phew-ee, phew-ee.

## Art Roundup

This week I posted the WIP crop of the Astra*Mix Minis logo. Can you believe I'm still not done with it?

![A logo being designed in Adobe Illustrator. It says Astra Mix Minis](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\SocMed%20Wips\2024\20240128_194340%20nwm-1080.png)

The gradient stuff along the edges… Took a really long time. I was doing it an inefficient way at first, but mid-way I found a better way of going about it and started all over. (Split/segmented vector blends of a colored circle along a path, clipped to an outline of the text.) But I'm happy to say, _**I finished that part. Among other parts.**_ All I gotta do now is... maybe add more shine and gradients to parts. In other words, just render the darned thing more.

No short video this week, actually… cause… I haven't been drawing anything content-y or ready to release. It's just the comic and a bunch of figure/gesture drawings.

## Art Progress

There's the aforementioned logo progress…! It's almost done. Then I can upload comics and start making more.

Outside of that, I've been really wanting to be a faster/looser/rougher/free-er sketcher so I've been changing the way I approach sketching. Been looking at my... current sketch-inspiration, Matty ([RadicallyMaxton](https://radicallymaxton.carrd.co/)); hopped onto their Patreon to get insight on their process, etc. I love looking at their sketchbooks so much. It's funny how, despite that, I doubt the effectiveness of posting _**my own**_ sketches online. I think artists might appreciate them more than non-artists, and I think posting things _**only**_ other artists like is ineffective when you're a small-fry like me. All that rambling to say IDK if I wanna share my recent sketches or not. I'll post like _ONE_ to wider Soc-Med and a compilation of recent ones to... Ko-Fi Dwarf Stars I guess. That's where all the "IDK if people'd care" stuff goes.

I need to launch my Ko-Fi shop cause I have zines and stickers just sitting in my room... waiting to be homed... I... do not like how Ko-Fi makes me calculate shipping by myself though. My friend-- moot?? (IDK at what point I'm allowed to call people my friends—) my moot, Doodle ([Doodlemancy](https://doodlemancy.com/)), alerted me about PirateShip though, so I might use that to help me calculate.

After that darned logo is out of the way I can't wait to get back to illustrations and doodles too. That Splatoon drawing is calling for me to finish it.

## Art Thoughts

No… wider, art-community-related thoughts this week. I've just been thinking about late-stage capitalism and how tired everyone is. And how everyone works, works, and works only to get laid off, or not paid enough to live comfortable, restful, lives. All while CEOs/execs/shareholders don't lift a finger and yet live comfortable, restful, lives. Weird.

This week I made a [Black Comic Artists art share on BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kkgyf46p322z) expecting a ton of people to join in... It got a lot of boosts and support from presumably _**non-**_black comic artists, but including me, there were only 4 participants! I'll try and breathe more life into it throughout the month, but, I really hope the lack of participation isn't representative of a lack of black creatives in the comics and webcomics industry. I'd rather believe it means they're all still on The Site Formerly Known as Twitter.

## Ko-Fi Corner

I almost forgot! On the 7th of this month, that's Wednesday, I have a speedpaint video going out to all [Ko-Fi Dwarf Star members](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers). Of which there are none. _The first could be **you!**_ It's that ink drawing I did of Harun, except it's a fourteen-minute screen recording this time. _Schnazzy!_

I'll toss the real-time video into the void that is the... experimental [Wish Star tier](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers).

...and that's all for this week! I gotta go pack my lunches so I can sacrifice 40hrs of my life to _**The Man...**_

Smell ya later!
