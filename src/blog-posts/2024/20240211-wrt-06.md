My goodness, how the week flies. It's time for another Weekly RoundUp Thing! This week has been simultaneously one of the best… and worst?? The most exhilarating… and most stressful?! Weeks in my life?!?! Let's get into it.

## Art Roundup

Bluesky Social launched (to the public) this week, and welcoming everyone has been some of the most fun I've had in a long time! I made this doodle at work to celebrate. I've been getting back into my sketchbook since changing my sketch process (as mentioned in last week's entry) and that's been a lot of fun as well!

Shared a full, public WIP (wow, rare!) of a chibi I'll be using in the scroll-footer of my webcomic collection! I've actually completed this chibi and you'll see it real soon! (Both in, and out of scroll-comics I guess.) Surprised at how nice it turned out cause I tend to... struggle to draw myself when I'm not doing so hot IRL.

## Art Progress

_The webcomic(-collection) logo is almost done, **[FORREAL, FORREAL, FORREAL THIS TIME.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuQemHtE354)**_ Seriously! I'll probably finish it tonight, even.

I felt a little guilty welcoming so many artists to BlueSky by retweeting their work that I asked my friends for stuff to draw. I drew my friend Dem's OC, Daia! And I'll be sharing that with you all this upcoming week. One thing Weekly Roundup Thing always reminds me to do is to post the [HD version to Ko-Fi Supporters](https://ko-fi.com/i/IH2H4UDWLC). (One-off supporters get 30-day access to the HD feed, btw!)

## Ko-Fi Corner

Quick Ko-Fi Corner update, Ko-Fi's trying to make it _very clear_ in their new TOS that they can nuke your account for violating their TOS; for reasons including adult content and copyright infringement. Like, they put the site behind an _**"agree to the TOS update or log out"**_-wall, so I think they really mean it.

So… I took my LadyNoir wallpapers off my shop. I'll be handing out the LadyNoir stickers I wanted to sell for free at FanimeCon 2024 instead. I still plan to sell my physical and digital sketch zines though! Especially now that I have more time. Speaking of…

## Life Update

Fortunately and unfortunately, I'll have more free time for a while cause I was laid off from my job. Reportedly due to no fault on my part. My professional self-esteem still took a hit though! Please let me know of any **comic-lettering, graphic design, book design, and web design opportunities** through [my contact form](https://hikatamika.com/contact/). I'm working on updating my [public portfolio](https://www.foriio.com/hikatamika) with new work, but I love to whip up PDF portfolios tailored to the positions I'm applying for.

## Art Thoughts

I'm so happy right now (weird to say after the prior paragraph, but…)! [BlueSky](https://bsky.social/) [opened up for signups on Tuesday, Feb 6th](https://bsky.social/about/blog/02-06-2024-join-bluesky), and welcoming people has been an absolute blast. I really have a lot of faith in the platform/network as a place for artists.

That said, I think one of the main things that makes it better than the social media platforms most are more used to, is probably what makes it the most confusing to a lot of artists. _**The lack of a built-in, 1st party algorithm of some sort**_. Twitter, IG, TikTok… we artists are used to having a central algorithm as something both to _climb_, and, to help us _discover others_. I hope to make an Artist's Guide to BlueSky once my VTuber model is done, but in the meantime, I've made starter packs for both _[Feeds](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kkrce3iyb42i)_ and _[Mute Lists](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kkr67pof2c2w)_ on there.

Feeds are more or less like opt-in algorithms and searches, that appear as separate tabs in your app (of choice! I like to use [Deck.Blue](https://deck.blue/)). Feeds come in all sorts of shapes and sizes, from the classic "[For You](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:wqowuobffl66jv3kpsvo7ak4/feed/the-algorithm)"-type experience, to the topic-based "[Magical Girls](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6vrf44pabqhagogoibjbc42y/feed/aaaotbk6umjfm)" or the topic+algorithm "[Art: What's Hot](https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:odqmsar3ikz5ubokya4sempk/feed/aaabfn4o34jdi)".  
If we can remind users that the people and content they see are their choice (that they have to set up a bit in the beginning), I think they'll stick around and come to enjoy it! (I personally get a bit miffed when For You Pages misunderstand my interests.)

I also hope that on BlueSky, people'll be more ~~retweet~~ repost happy than they were on other sites. People _used_ to share a lot on Twitter… then, as people started getting hired because of their profiles, they became more reluctant to uplift others. During this _BlueSky Welcoming Week_ of sorts, I and many others have been very repost-happy to make the place warm, engaging, and exciting to others. I hope that spirit persists. It should!! We should be _**social**_ on social media. [Go make your portfolio somewhere else!](https://www.foriio.com/)
