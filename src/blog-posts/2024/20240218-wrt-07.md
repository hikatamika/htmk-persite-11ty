Hey guys, hayyy!! Time for another Weekly Roundup Thing!! I'm excited for this one and this upcoming week, so let's get it.

## Art Roundup

First, lemme get some post prompts out of the way.

"Post something toothy!" [I reposted Ashe.](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3klcmvkrn5x2y)

"Post with your angel OC!" [I reposted Hevel and Aziel.](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3klnje3b76227)

_*****PUSHES THOSE OUT OF THE WAY WITH CARTOON SOUND EFFECTS*****_

On Tuesday I posted my doodle of Dem's OC Daia, and people seemed to really like it!! Thank you! I had a lot of fun with it. I like manga doodles cause I can complete 'em in good time. And, I guess I don't have to worry about monochrome not being appealing enough or junk like that.

On Wednesday, (Happy Belated Valentine's, I guess!) I shared this WIP of a promo chibi for the webcomic shorts. Thanks for the love on a WIP, everyone!

This week's video post was an art reveal of Daia, featuring the preliminary sketch. Cause I still can't trust my short video audience to sit through a timelapse, no offense. ðŸ˜­ I tried to experiment with posting in the evening, but, only Instagram Reels took well to that, so I guess I'll go back toâ€¦ the break of dawn on TikTok and the afternoon on YouTube.

## Art Progress

ðŸ’…Guess who finished the Astra*Mix Minis logo~!ðŸ’… _**ME!**_ I did. At first, it was more pseudo-3D, but, looking at design trends in current comic logos and in graphic design in generalâ€¦ I took off the main 3D part. I think it still has nostalgic, Frutiger Aero charm though. Heaven forbid I go [FULL FLAT](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jAaxVuz0uKk) with my (personal) graphic design.

I also finished,

- An episode header chibi for the first episode,
- Two episode headerâ€¦ icons(???) for the first episode,
- A footer chibi and icon for the whole seriesâ€¦

It felt likeâ€¦ a whole lot!! And I did all of it! Even though I started off the week pretty bummedâ€¦

Anyway, I'll make one of the chibis next week's post. I don't wanna post all the new stuff at once, in case I get lucky by getting hired (and therefore busy) sooner than I'd expect.

Next up is whipping up the scroll header & footer template for Astra*Mix's "episode" adaptationsâ€¦

Oh yeah, my VTuber modeler got back to me with the first pass of the 3D mesh, and it's lookin' PRETTY DANG GOOD. I'm really excited to be able toâ€¦ carry out video scripts I've written in an interesting and engaging way. Maybe I'll show y'all a preview the next time I get a sneak peak.

## Art Thoughts

I don't have many specific online-art-community thoughts this weekâ€¦ At least none that I haven't mentioned before. So I'd just like to say thanks to everyone for being so nice and friendly to me on [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com). I, uhhh, I wanted to make a BlueSky-themed piece and Art Share for 500 followers though, which I'm kinda close to, I'm _**NOT**_ allowed to reach 500 before I finish it!! /j /j /j

And, even before I do that, I want to make an art piece in support of Palestine because the attacks that happened to Palestinians in Rafah on Sunday absolutely caught me off guard and got me _especially_ upset.

Anyway. That's all for this week. Smell ya later and stuff!
