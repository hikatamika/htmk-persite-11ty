Goodness gracious, I can't believe it's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing already. A ton happened this week, but let me start with the art.

## Art Roundup

On Monday I did the [#OCArtist Art Share on Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kmddgom6tw2u) to commemorate 500 followers and tons of people participated! Thanks so much! I was really happy to see people talking amongst themselves and meeting up with other artists in the replies! That's all I wanted out of it really. I found cool people to follow, add to my Recommended Art feed, or both, as well.

[If you haven't taken a look at the participants, I implore you to!](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kmddgom6tw2u) I kicked it off by sharing some [older doodles of Amity](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kmddgom6tw2u) (Lux Pink in her civilian form). I think they're also somewhere [in my art gallery](https://hikatamika.com/art-gallery/).

On Tuesday, I posted the chibi promo art I'll be using for most, if not all of the LXNX-centered Astra*Mix Minis episodes, [a chibi of Lux Pink](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kmfxad7zum2v)! People seemed to really like it on BlueSky and X. Thank you!

On Wednesday, I uploaded the first episode of [Astra*Mix Minis](https://namicomi.com/en/title/yJ42F2Vs/astra-mix-minis)! It was an AU of Lux Pink and Lux Viridian in a (Dreamworks) Trolls 3 AU cause my friend gave me brainworms for it. Astra*Mix Minis isâ€¦ what I _plan_ to be a _monthly_ series of comic-strip-like pages and scrolls of my OCs in non-plot-relevant/spoiling situations (cause I still want to make proper serializedâ€¦ series someday). If that sounds intriguing to you, I hope you'll subscribe to it [by RSS](https://hikatamika.com/astramix/astramix-rss/) or [on your favorite webcomic platforms](https://hikatamika.com/astramix/).

For now, my mates seem to be reading it which is all I can really ask for both _this early,_ and _for a project like this_.

_**Oh yeah, almost forgot,**_ on Thursday [I posted an art reveal of the chibi I did](https://youtube.com/shorts/cgkuwqi9kS4), and I tried to make it the most, key-jingling, short-attention-span-friendly, and non-artist entertaining short video I could, but I forgot one thing.

![YouTube Shorts retention graph. On the frame where the art is revealed, viewers start to swipe away.](20240303-01.jpg)

I used the "treat people the way you'd like to be treated" method and gave people a few seconds at the end of the video to take in the art they saw, which might make sense for long-form videos, but for short vertical content, viewers take that as their cue to leave. So, they left 5 seconds early, nerfing my watch-time and placement in the algorithm.

But, somehow, the opposite feels worse! Cutting the video off short so people have to loop it to see my art piece clearly would logically make my video perform better, but it feels like an abuse of human behavioral patterns. IDK how to explain. Oh well.

## Art Thoughts

This week we're switching up the section order cause [Tumblr sold all its user data to MidJourney](https://www.404media.co/tumblr-and-wordpress-to-sell-users-data-to-train-ai-tools/) to be used in AI, allowing them easier and more categorized access to our text and images than scraping could provide. Its parent company Automattic sold all Wordpress_**.com**_ (Wordpress-hosted-Wordpress) images and user data too, which is wild. Even wilder, [Automattic is selling off Wordpress**.org** (Self-hosted-Wordpress) user data that has been sped up by its blog optimization plugin, Jetpack](https://www.404media.co/wordpress-firehose-allows-ai-companies-to-buy-access-to-a-million-posts-a-day/).

This was crazy and shook up the internet because Tumblr is one of the most popular and longest-standing art sites (despite an exodus and many a whoopsie), especially for fandoms of pop culture IPs. And, WordPress is like _**the**_ CMS of choice and has been for a long time. Plenty of artists use it for their blogs and portfolios.

Investors and platforms are colonizing, harvesting, and profiting off their userbases in a way that's really disgusting and unbelievable to me, and it's causing me a lot of _**Thoughtsâ„¢**_, but I'll shove the rest of those thoughts into a zine or something. For now, Tumblr users, head into the settings of each side blog you have and disable Third Party Sharing of your content. [Allegedly Tumblr will then tell MidJourney to pull your stuff out of the data package they already sent.](https://www.tumblr.com/jv/743516187594457088/jv-and-about-the-ai-opt-out-setting-tumblr-will) Jury's out on whether they'll actually follow through. Wordpress.org users should disable the Jetpack plugin entirely, or, disable the parts of the plugin that speed up images by re-hosting them on Automattic's servers.

## Art Progress

![Screenshot of a sketch of my OC marching with the Palestinian flag.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\SocMed%20Wips\2024\20240301_%202024-03-01_b-nightshade-intensity-LOW-V1.png)

Back to your regularly scheduled Art Progress! Stuff happened, but I posted [the WIP of my protest piece for Palestine](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kmp4jauwau22). Obviously, the final piece will be way late for the Day of Action that was this Saturday, but the situation there and mirroring ones going on elsewhere still weigh heavily on my mind.

Today I sketched the background and am psyching myself up to ink and renderâ€¦ the 2nd WIP is on Ko-Fi, etc., etc., etc. but it's not all that different. Just added tiles on the ground and some olive branches.

![Pink, promotional business card with my art on it.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\SocMed%20Wips\2024\20240303_%202024-03-01-nwm.jpg)

![Pink, promotional bookmark with my art on it.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\SocMed%20Wips\2024\20240303_%202024-03-01_c-nwm.jpg)

I made some business cards and bookmarks to give out at FanimeCon (attending, not tabling) later this year. Sent 'em off to print, the whole shebang. Might make charms of the chibi I did to give out if I meet up with any bestiesâ€¦ IDK, might be working with a m8 of mine to make some stickersâ€¦ which TBH I'd also give out, and then anything left over, I'd sell on my Ko-Fi Shop. ðŸ˜­ As an OC artist I don't feel all that confident about the idea of tabling at an anime-con anyway. An art market or zinefest, maybe.

â€¦aaaaand that's all for this week! Thanks for reading. I'm sorry it's a lot, but I feel like blogging is my only outlet for this kind of thing right now. At least until my VTuber model is finished. Then I can talk your ear off. In the meantime, [see you online,](https://hikatamika.com/links/) and see you later!
