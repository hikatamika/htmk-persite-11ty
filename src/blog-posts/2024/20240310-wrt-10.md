It's time for a time-warp-y episode of WEEKLY! ROUNDUP!! THING!!!

## Art Roundup

Unfortunately, the Art Roundup is just‚Ä¶ development sketches. No pieces. No videos. Nada.

Because I've been frustrated about tech and the future, _and_ because I needed a new character for a #relatable sticker design, I made a new OC, Clay, for my cyberpunk world. He slotted into the rest of that story with a goal, a purpose, and a backstory quite smoothly, might I add. Weird how my brain can do that.

Unfortunately, because I don't consider this "finished art", it never left BlueSky. Whoops. IDK what the WIP/Sketch/Doodle culture is, on other sites. Especially the gallery-esque and DeviantArt-replacement-type sites that I post to.

## Art Progress

So, Clay's deal started out that he couldn't move his face, at all, because he's a more affordable line of android made to take on tough and potentially dirty work without needing to frequently replace the pseudo-skin on his face from stains caused by work, or micro-tears from facial expression. **HOWEVER,** right now I'm moreso feeling that he can move his face, but has a lesser range of motion than more expensive androids made to be companions or TV show hosts. Despite the concept change, he still has lesser expressiveness for the same reason; replacement faces are expensive.

ALL THAT TO SAY, I'm testing how much I like that idea by putting him through the ol' Pixiv Expression Meme! And I'm at 7/12 expressions inked. Phew. I'll be turning that into a zine cause why not! It'll be like an Inktober zine, kinda. With character About-Me vibes.

Right now I'm also helping two friends with logos for future projects. I also have the 2nd episode of Astra*Mix Minis to board and ink, and I started mind-mapping and outlining brain-dumps that I want to turn into two essay zines‚Ä¶ a lot is going on!

On top of that I gotta keep sending out job applications‚Ä¶ kinda crazy! I wish I could do a little bit of each thing every day, but my like, at-home, unregulated, work method is to like, switch tasks by the day. Hrm.

OH YEAH! My handout goodies for FanimeCon came this week! I'm excited to hand 'em out. They look really nice in person. I shared a [CMYK printing hack](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kn57urlyuc2o) that I remembered to do for one of the items and not the rest, and‚Ä¶ yeah. The trick works. When used! Haha. I'll show off what I'm giving away closer to May.

[I also finished inking my illustration in support of Palestine!](https://ko-fi.com/i/IN4N4VIY3T) Coloring it intimidates me cause I haven't colored an illustration-y illustration in a while, but it'll probably turn out ok. Israel is kinda wack for Tweeting out a Ramadan Kareem post while blasting Rafah on night one of Ramadan but lemme just hush up right there for now. üòî

## Art Thoughts

This'll be another week of me saving most of my art thoughts #ForTheZine, but I just wanna say I'm glad that other people are feeling me [on community and uplifting others being the key to making the future of the online art community bright](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3knenothnkd2j).

If I could do one thing to make the world a better place, right now, it'd be to spread that idea around like wildfire. Try üîÅ re-sharing üîÅ your friends' work, this upcoming week!
