Cause it's still Sunday in California. I got distracted!! Weekly Roundup Thing time!

## Art Roundup

Guess who doesn't have any new pieces! **_THIS GUUUUUYYYYY!!_** The reason I have no new art pieces this week is… _I was busy writing the essay that'll become one of my first zines!_ My brain just… really wanted to do it, so it was the Fixation of the Week.

## Art Progress

[This week, I showed a crop of the preview my modeler sent me of my YouTube model!](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3knh54zo22u2o) These boots were made for walkin', heheh… We're wrapping up the texturing and moving onto the rigging… which is exciting! Especially since I upgraded to faster internet! Streams and videos soon!

As I was rendering my OC art piece for Palestine, I wondered if there was a quicker way to whip up some shadows in Blender… Lo and behold, there is! I used Perspective Plotter to match Blender's camera to the perspective of my drawing, tossed up just the character and objects as two planes, set up a ground plane as a shadow catcher, and was able to get a transparent shadow PNG for my CSP file! Cool stuff. I just wanna figure out the typography for this one before preparing it for SocMed.

## Art Thoughts

I fully expect our boomer government to go ahead and ban TikTok no matter how much we kick, beg, and scream for cross-platform data privacy bills instead of a "ban sites from countries we don't like" bill. So, I don't really know what wise thing I can say about _that_.

Everything has been really Peace and Love on Planet Earth in the art community over at BlueSky lately, which is nice. WELL, there are some growing pains with the composable moderation or however you call it. I do prefer moderation that I subscribe to over than Masto's moderation-at-my-admins'-discretion, BUT, something kinda lame for Bluesky right now is that, if you yourself flag your content, BSky 1st Party Content Moderation can overwrite it. The thing bugging most people is that the 1st party moderation, which is done by bot, can sometimes inaccurately put a harsher content label than the one OP put.

Tangentially, my All-Ages, CocoMelon, Weenie Hut Jr. self is worried for my adult-art friends, as Patreon has severely limited what they're able to host on the platform, and GumRoad is kicking them off altogether. If this concerns you, or you just wanna support your adult-art peers, [here's one petition you can sign](https://bsky.app/profile/pompoison.bsky.social/post/3knrbodjzzm2b), and [here's another](https://action.aclu.org/petition/mastercard-sex-work-work-end-your-unjust-policy).

Today, while looking for graphics for my zine, I found out that Webtoons is going beyond [that one Webtoons photo filter based off of some of their Webtoons Originals](https://ai.webtoons.com/en/toonfilter/installGuide), [they're working on an AI branch of their company, Webtoon AI](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3knvwibuyl22h). And, [they wanna make something that'll color/render your work](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3knvymybzk32z) (Webtoon AI PAINTER), along with other projects called Webtoon AI EDITOR, Webtoon AI SHAPER, and Webtoon AI CURATOR. which I couldn't find descriptions for. [The source for the descriptions I _could_ find, is right here](https://www.koreatechdesk.com/koreas-webtoon-industry-growth-remarkable-as-creators-embrace-ai-innovation-for-global-expansion/).
