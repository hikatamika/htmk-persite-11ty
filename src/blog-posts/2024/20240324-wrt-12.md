*Long, drawn out, deep in thought sigh‚Ä¶* Howdy everyone!! ü´° It's time for another Weekly Roundup thing.

## Art Roundup

[![My original character, a blue, hijabi, magical hero, marching with a Palestinian flag. Olive branches hang from a tree.

I'm proud to announce that I _**did**_ finish new art this week!! The art piece I did in support of Palestine!! Re: the "draw your comfort character holding the flag" prompt, but you know how OC-headed I can be, heh. On my social media posts for it, I linked (where I could,) the [Dami Falasteeni](https://damifalasteeni.neocities.org/) NeoCities page, a good hub of resources on both the history between Israel and Palestine, and places where you can donate to support the people in Gaza. Great site!

No video for the piece, this week, cause I was too busy humming and hawing over other things‚Ä¶

## Art Progress

One of which being‚Ä¶ **_the HK‚òÖTMK Shop_**. üßç Which is like, done in its most 1.0 form, right now (still not open for orders yet though, sorry)! There are still some art assets I'd like to make for certain pages and Thank-You flyers and stuff, but everything that needed to be done to host products and take orders‚Ä¶ is done. And, I've actually had some shop stock in my room for quite a long time. You may notice that‚Ä¶ Lux Pink chibi stickers aren't in that screenshot!! That's cause I'm afraid that if I sold them right now, I wouldn't have any to give out at FanimeCon this year, haha. What worries me is the future of other lines of items. Especially prints.

I, _uhh_, can't afford the kind of printer I _think_ I need right now (a tank-based [not cartridge?? supposedly cartridges'll come after your wallet??] printer that takes CMYK + a separate photographic black + potentially, a gray), but I'm not even sure if I _need_ a printer specifically marked as a photo printer. Something I know for sure is I want a large format one so I can trim my prints to size instead of going for borderless printing, which oversprays within the printer and requires cleaning if used often. Mangaka are already sustaining injuries and running out of time **_without_** having to babysit printers‚Ä¶ how could _**I**_ manage?? I'll probably outsource with Staples (for SketchZine covers [which are always a color copy of the sketchbook I scanned the art from]) and CatPrint (for illustration prints) until I get another job.

Stickers, I'm quite fine with outsourcing because I don't think anyone could pay me to roll laminate or fight with a cutting machine. And, I'm quite confident about most of the zines I'm working on, cause I can print them as people order them on my current monochrome laser printer. I even got cute colored paper for the covers! And, I enjoy working in B/W + screentone anyway.

Stickers! Zines! Prints! Those'll probably be the three core product lines I stick with until I can feel confident that I'm starting to make things that people are resonating with. Which is really hard when you're a terminally OC-brained artist that hasn't shared much about your OCs' lives with people.

## Art Thoughts

Having dived head-first into Artist Alley and Art Shop resources a lot this week, a recurring art thought has been a tug of war in my mind over whether I should draw _what I love drawing_, my original characters, or whether I should draw _what I know people love engaging with,_ pop-culture fanart. Fanart has the inconvenience of DMCA takedowns, but original characters have the issue of no one knowing who they are or what they're about until you start telling people about them. Which I have _[slowly started doing](https://hikatamika.com/astramix/)_, to be fair, but it'll be a bit of a while until I've shared enough with you all for you to love my characters, even a little, I think. üíÄ I dunno.

Again, if there's anything I feel comfortable about in the shop's near future, it's the zines, so look out for those. Should be making progress with those this week along with some commission work. Maybe I can squeeze in another Astra*Mix Minis episode this-or-next week too. We'll see!
