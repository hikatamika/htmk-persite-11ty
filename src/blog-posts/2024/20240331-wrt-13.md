Why do these weeks roll away so _**quickly,**_ bro? It's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing!

## Art Roundup

![The same OC, a young-man robot, making 4 expressions. The first is bored/neutral, the second is a polite smile. The third is a smiling glare, and finally, sadness on the inside with a smile on the outside.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240306_ClayExpressions3_150_P1-gwm.png)

This week I posted 4 of the 12 expressions I did for The Pixiv Expression Meme, featuring my newest OC, Clay!! All 12 are done… just figured I'd spread things out a bit. Especially with how busy planning the HK★TMK Shop can be… phew…

Tangentially, I also shared some new art of Hevel I made to use as a stamp on order envelopes and parcels. I repurposed the chibis from Astra★Mix Minis promo into stamps as well!

## Art Progress

Low-key, besides the new art stamp, I don't think I drew anything (thumbnail drawings excluded,) this week because I was too busy making sure I finished [one of two design commissions I had open](https://bsky.app/profile/darkhalo4321.bsky.social/post/3kovbxgsip32q). It turned out quite nice though! Now for the other one!

I also wanna make sure I finish the zine-exclusive doodles for the Clay Expression Meme Zine soon, so I can launch the shop with it. Then there's the essay zines after that, and returning to comics and illustrations, (_**my usual deal[!!!!]**_), after that. Phew. All that on top of job search and returning to driving lessons.

## Art Thoughts

I don't have any grand art thoughts about art and the Internet this week, but, I have been thinking about art "IRL". I think there might be room for me both online and in-person as someone who sells art and comics of my original characters; which is a fun, and scary thought. For such a long time, my art has rarely left the screen, but printing tests of the Clay-zine this past week… like… idk how to explain. I'm starting to realize making my digital art physical in order to share it might be my new favorite part, and something I'd like to be a more regular part of my process??

I'm trying to make sure I don't paralyze myself with the possibilities, so I'm going to try to focus _this_ branch of my efforts on the online store for a good while. But I'll definitely be visiting more zine-fests and anime/manga/comic-themed art markets this year to scope out the vibe. (General art markets scare me cause I feel like my work has no normie appeal. And, while I do like attending anime cons, the idea of tabling with 90-95% original-character art stock scares me as well [I feel like the original stuff that does the best at anime cons is like… kawaii vector art of shiba-inus and onigiris and stuff]). It scares me less than it used to!! But still a bit. Especially with how expensive con tables are now.

Anyway, that's all for this week. See you next time!
