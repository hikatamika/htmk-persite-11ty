My initial thought was like "this week was weird, I'm sorry‚Äî" It's another one of those‚Ä¶ invisible-work weeks. üìØ It's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing! üìØ

## Art Roundup
{% ytShortsEmbed "pc6IyFRsHmY" %}

I guess technically, I _did_ post art this week. I posted an art reveal of March's Nox Indigo piece to the usual short video suspects, TikTok, Reels, and Shorts. As usual, Reels' algorithm didn't care, TikTok's one kinda cared, and Shorts' one cared immensely!

‚Ä¶I'm gonna stop thinking about what makes these algorithms like/dislike a video and just try to post an art reveal per illustration. General audiences on there don't sit through timelapses. Speaking of, [the timelapse and speedpaint for this piece are up for grabs for Dwarf Star Ko-Fi members!](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers) Mentioning that is foolish, but so is forgetting to mention it, so‚Ä¶ ü§®

## Art Progress
I did work this week that doesn't feel like work cause it has nothing to do with finished comics, zines, or illustrations üíÄ. I worked on more art for the Clay zine, tried, failed, then rescued attempts at taking product photos for the shop, tried to reconnect with gesture and pose‚Ä¶ and tried to reconnect with illustration in general? Which like, feels like a lot, when I list it out, but a voice in my head is like "yeah, then, _where's the posts, **dummy?!**_"

There are‚Ä¶ no posts for these things. Most of them anyway. _*Throws this so it feels like the effort I put in actually exists.*_

It's a good thing Portfolio Day is this upcoming week (regurgitated art!!)‚Ä¶ cause I have a job interview and a DMV appointment. Which aren't a lot on their own, but my neurology sure be diverging if you know what I mean.

## Art Thoughts

For this week's Art Thoughts segment, I figured I'd share the conclusions I reached while trying to reconnect with illustration. (Don't worry, I'm never disconnected from drawing in general, I just got disconnected with the stuff that typically becomes poster-prints or content.)

I was troubleshooting my own mind, asking why I don't draw uploads (key phrasing there, draw uploads‚Ä¶ draw things that I feel are uploads‚Ä¶) often enough. Often I draw a little sketch and feel happy with that process and letting the result live on paper or in my hard drive. It's like this. I only feel like taking an illustration to completion:

- If it has to do with my OCs
- I have a really cool or strong feeling/theme/pose/background in my imagination.

If I ever have an idea that doesn't contain both of those things, I just wanna sketch it for sketch's sake and move on. Leading to a lot of Hika-drawings that don't get uploaded, making me look-to-others and feel-to-myself that‚Ä¶ I don't draw. The couple of times I've drawn fanart last year for example (and heck, 1 or 2 of the OC pieces too if I have to be honest)‚Ä¶ I really half-assed it because I wasn't engaged with the work because‚Ä¶ none of the above bullet points were met.

I went to Instagram trending to see what the algorithm's favoring these days. (And, mind you, the algorithm does _not_ have a mind of its own. Engagement drives its behavior.) So yeah, I went and looked and like‚Ä¶ all the trends are:

- Fanart (isn't a problem in a vacuum, just tricky for my OC-Brainworms‚Ñ¢ motivation)
- Just, "Boom, here's the character here you go". Not much is going on in composition/emotion/or theme.

This isn't to say I'm saying my trending feed has like, poker-face syndrome in the faces that they draw. It's just more like, they're not trying to use their art to express a feeling/vibe/aesthetic to me? Just like, "this is a character the masses resonate with. Here you go." And people, in their shared experiences of liking these characters, engage, and the work floats to the top of the algorithm. The character _**is**_ the feeling. Valid. Fair enough.

I looked at my inspirations to try and deduce what it is I like in illustrations so I can put out more of them. Mainly the Naoko Takeuchi art books, the colored inserts from the CardCaptor Sakura Omnibus, Our Dreams at Dusk, and other colored manga illustrations as well. I discovered I like when it's not the _character_ that's the feeling, they're just one of multiple vehicles used to _**deliver**_ a _separate_ feeling/vibe/aesthetic. I've put the other vehicles I noticed into the following categories:

- **Backdrops:** Loose or abstract backgrounds and props not focused on tying the character to space or perspective. A common shoujo example are flowers and their petals, or loosely painted shapes meant to represent clouds or foliage. It's almost like the characters are in a stage play, and painted backdrops, cutouts, props, and confetti represent real-world elements.

- **Cast Shots:** Those illustrations where full-bodies of the cast are standing around in cool arrangements, or busts of the cast overlap each other in cool ways. Typically in a background for the former kind, and over a backdrop for the latter. What's even more fun is when cast shots have a theme to the costuming/backdrop. For example, the cast, but _Alice in Wonderland themed!_ Why? Just cause! Cast-shots can also be themed to whatever situation the characters are currently finding themselves in in the source material. My Hero Academia does that quite often. Movie posters do that too.

- **Hero Shots:** For me, these are easy to make boring or inexpressive of a vibe, so I have to be careful the next time I try one. In a Hero Shot the camera is closely focusing on the characters, in front of a background that's non-existent, or graphical. They aren't really connected to it in the same way a character's connected to a "traditional background" or even a backdrop. Usually these are made interesting by the action or interaction that characters are doing. Grabbing an object, yelling at another character, that's what makes or breaks a hero shot most of the time. "Confetti items" and props help here.

- **Scenarios:** Probably the hardest for people not used to backgrounds, but very easy to express a vibe with. This is when you put characters, in a specific place, and have them do stuff. The scenario and its vibes can be grounded and literal, say, _Usagi and her friends by the pool_ (Sailor Moon), or abstract, _Tasuku looking at both of Shuji's gender expressions in a fishbowl_ (Our Dreams at Dusk) _while fish swim both in the fishbowl, and throughout the composition_. Whether the scenario is real-world or fantastical, there's a greater sense of space and perspective in these kinds of compositions than the Backdrop type, and of course, they always express a vibe. Many artists have both types of pieces in their portfolios.

- **Silhouette/Frame:** These are good for expressing emotion, and the relationships between multiple characters, or multiple facets of the same character. In a silhouette composition, the focus is on the shapes made when shots of characters overlap each other in interesting ways, or, when elements of a character's design frame other characters in interesting ways. Naoko Takeuchi implemented this technique a _**lot**_ because it's easy to make interesting frames out of Usagi's hair. Other methods of framing are geometric shapes, vines/stems of foliage, or drawn picture frames.

**_Yap, yap, yap,_** TL;DR I like it when people use composition, backgrounds (simple, or spatial), and foreground elements to try and make me feel something from their art instead of only providing me with a character to feel something about. Unless that character is a friend's OC. OCs all override this rule for me in my brain because of the closer relationships I have with their creators than the relationships I (don't) have with the creators of pop culture characters and fandom.

All that said, this deep dive has got me thinking that I _might,_ _**might,**_ be capable of enjoying drawing fanart if I can think about feelings or aspects of a pop culture character I'd like to express using the above techniques. I've gotten so used to "here's the character‚Äîokay, bye"-fanart because that's all I see from the algorithm. Because it's faster to make that kind of art _**for**_ the algorithm. But who knows.

No matter the subject, OC or fanart, I feel I can get back into enjoying illustration if I try to use background, foreground, and composition to make the viewer feel more than just "here's the character," so I'll make sure to keep trying that going forward. I did that in my last piece, with the feeling I wanted to express being "why is Israel committing genocide", without knowing that having something I wanted to express was the reason I was able to motivate myself to illustrate that (with soft-shading, even! _**SHEESH!!**_) to begin with.

The next illustration I do won't be that deep, it'll probably be more on the "omg the cast but what if Alice in Wonderland instead!!"-side of the expression spectrum, but I'll probably enjoy myself just as much!

Anyways sorry for yapping in your ear. Wish me luck. (That interview & DMV combo is too much for one week!) I'll smell ya later!
