## Art Roundup

My rubber OC stamps for my store came this week so I showed them off on [all the Social Media‚Ñ¢s](https://hikatamika.com/links/)!

I even used the unboxing (always record your unboxings) as this week's video content! And I have two more saved up for the future! _Phew‚Ä¶_

## Art Progress

This week I felt sad/bad/weird for my low fanart attention-span/dopamine-associations so I tested myself to see if I was capable of just buckling down and doing some. I uhh‚Ä¶ managed to draw [a chibi and a square illustration](https://ko-fi.com/i/IW7W4WS298). üò∂üíß Using some of the atmosphere/background techniques I mentioned in last week's Roundup too! And, though I have love for the source material‚Ä¶ I was noticeably not as "wired" and excited as I can get when drawing my/my friends' OCs. The process was nice though. Chibis done. Will color the illustration after tending to some responsibilities.

I've still got comms and zine work to do. (Chipped away at both this week tho!) I was just kinda, not-quite-but-almost **_bullying_** _myself??_ Like, "BE A NORMAL ARTIST AND DRAW FANART, **_GOOFBALL!_**" and the results were honestly inconclusive.

I also did a lot of perspective/foreshortening and dynamic gesture doodles that made me really proud, though! I don't like making character-on-no-background (/no implied background/no graphic background) illustrations anymore so they'll probably just stay doodles on my hard drive until I compile them into a zine or something.

OH YEAH AND I RENEWED MY DRIVER'S PERMIT! (Yay!) And I‚Ä¶ declined the job offer cause I didn't wanna work late that far away from home‚Ä¶ (kind of a cold-feet situation). More of a **Life Progress** update, but still.

## Art Thoughts

This week I've been thinking about how‚Ä¶ my following on BlueSky grows while on other sites it stays still. BlueSky makes it a lot easier to be social, and for that friendliness in your engagement with others to have a positive reflection on your growth. All the algorithm-heavy sites‚Ä¶ make that harder. And on those, I'm just expected to sit around until I make art so good that it inspires people to comment, like-ratio, or watch-time me out of algorithm hell. _And it doesn't happen._ Cause people are in a hurry to scroll through as much content in one sitting to experience as many dopamine hits in one sitting. Which is fair because life in our society is so full of horrors that we need little hits of relief from but, it's tiring as a creator waiting for viewers to make the algorithm save you.

I hope BlueSky's friendly engagement culture bleeds into other sites as well. Though we also have a bit of a _manufactured_ engagement culture that wears me out sometimes (Art Shares where you post your four best pieces. That so many accounts conduct, _all the time_.

Art Share!&quot; &quot;It&#x27;s Wednesday Art Share Time!&quot; &quot;My cat sneezed. Time for a Free-For-All Art Share!!!&quot;

If they were more like, milestone-based, deviantArt/Pixiv style, or themed (OCs only, WIPs only, [specific theme] only) maybe we wouldn&#x27;t be so fatigued</p>&mdash; Hika/Tam | üîú Fanime &#x27;24 (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6vrf44pabqhagogoibjbc42y?ref_src=embed">@hikatamika.com</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:6vrf44pabqhagogoibjbc42y/post/3kq4up3w3q32x?ref_src=embed">Apr 14, 2024 at 4:14 PM</a></blockquote><script async src="https://embed.bsky.app/static/embed.js" charset="utf-8"></script>
```

So many artists posting their four best pieces over and over multiple times a week‚Ä¶ argh argh argh we're so engagement starved we're so traumatized by worst sites we're so‚Äî

Lemme stop right there. üßç  
See you next week! üôã
