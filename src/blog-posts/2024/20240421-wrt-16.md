(*With my fists on my hips*:) It's another Weekly Roundup Thing where I didn't upload anything new! But Art Thoughts are chonky this week!

## Art Roundup

While I didn't post anything new to the Internet, I posted some of my existing illustrations of the LuxNox gang to my new [SheezyArt Page](https://sheezy.art/hikatamika)! I even got a Pretty in Pink award for [my recent chibi of Lux Pink](https://sheezy.art/hikatamika/gallery/202402-amm-luxpink-chibi)!! üò≠üíú _(Maybe this'll be our new deviantArt. While I habitually crosspost to [Artfol](https://www.artfol.co/hikatamika) and [Inkblot](https://inkblot.art/profile/hikatamika), I don't see, like, my peers talking about either much, or the community at large frolicking around on there.)_

## Art Progress

That TotK Link chibi I mentioned as being done last week is still done‚Ä¶! I think I just lost the art of YOLO-posting. I can never just post stuff when it's done‚Ä¶ it's always gotta be part of some weird, calculated effort. In this case, I want to carousel it with a normal-proportioned drawing of Link I need to shade and color.

_Those_ got interrupted by a per-zine (personal/"diary"-esque mini-zine) that was absolutely leaping out of my soul to be made halfway through the week. With that I just need to ink and tone the B-side of it. Earlier in the week I made progress on the bonus drawings for the Clay Zine, finished a sticker for all the OC Enjoyers out there, and did some comm work.

It feels like every week a new project joins the club and gets added to the circus balls I juggle, and one makes it out. Priorities for this upcoming week are comm work above all else, then knocking out the mini per-zine cause that's a small-fry task, then back to everything else. The OC artist sticker will prolly stay in the drafts until the store launch‚Ä¶ which I need to do paperwork for still‚Ä¶

_**SHEESH,** where's my **PLANNER** at?!_

OH YEAH ALSO!! I got in touch with my VTuber modeler! My little guy is rigged and my modeler is refining it and making sure it exports well. Yippee!! Maybeeeeee preemptively follow my [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/HikaTamika) for some Pajama Sam 3? IDK. üò≥ I like the way my model looks in motion and I'm excited to use it, hee-hee.

Ok, now time for--

## Art Thoughts

As someone who would skim Threads for friendsies prior to like Thur/Friday I kinda‚Ä¶ don't think I can, anymore. At least for now. Like, on my feed I see my peers (rightfully) complain about how rough (and pay-to-win) the Instagram algorithm is, the failures of Meta's auto-modding (sniping friendly comments as engagement bating, and just the typical random suspensions [lost my side account that way a while back and nearly lost my main too!]). And their most recent nonsense, [their implementation of an a central AI chatbot to IG, FB, and WhatsApp](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/18/technology/meta-ai-assistant-push.html) along with [social media accounts for themed chatbots](https://about.fb.com/news/2023/09/social-profiles-for-metas-ai-characters/) (anime, sports, etc.).

Seeing people I side width in an endless loop of having things to rightfully complain about but being rightfully unable to leave coupled with Meta shoving AI junk in everyone's faces hit me in the old autistic strong-sense-of-justice and I was all _**"wE sHoUld aLl JuSt LeAve!!!"**_ in a way that was very mind-blind (another ASD trait that can cause you to be less intuitive about other people's thought processes and reasons for doing things) and in the end made me feel very bad and icky after the Meta stuff, and the me Internet yelling and the‚Ä¶ everything caught up with me and I had an ASD shutdown.

All that to say I'm sorry for being angry and mind-blind this week and I don't think I can browse Threads anymore. For the stuff that I see on my feed and because Zuck and Mosseri make such user-_LAST_ choices all the time and I don't like it. IIRC Threads' public API that'll allow me to post to it from third-party apps like [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) arrives in July, so until then I'll just be post-and-running. IDEK if I'll be able to check replies, really. Not until Meta makes their social media ecosystem an overall better place for its users; with or without the AI schlop.

The whole ordeal had me rethinking my usual crossposting rounds, which are as follows:

- [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com) (I love it here.)
- [SheezyArt](https://sheezy.art/hikatamika) (I'm impressed! Looks nice, I think I might enjoy myself.)
- [Artfol](https://artfol.me/hikatamika) (I love this one but it feels like the art-community zeitgeist is not picking it up. ‚òπÔ∏è)
- [Inkblot](https://inkblot.art/profile/hikatamika) (I have like‚Ä¶ issues with the UI. Doesn't feel like it's being picked up but I know the devs and contributors are good people.)
- [YouTube](https://youtube.com/@HikaTamika) (No problems here! I like the content that gets made here and am looking forward to hopping back in with more than just YT Shorts.)
- [TikTok](https://tiktok.com/@hikatamika) (I love the editor, hate the FYP, and have a rollercoaster relationship with the algorithm.)
- [CoHost](https://cohost.org/HikaTamika) (I do, like, non-existent numbers here, but I like what people reblog onto my dashboard.)
- [Mastodon](http://mastodon.art/@HikaTamika) (Habitual crossposting. I don't like the attitude that stereotypical Fedi-users have at certain topics and platforms that aren't Fedi. Also my admin isn't very like‚Ä¶ federation friendly but that's within her right as an admin.)
- [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/HikaTamika) (No one cares about my PixelFed, but it's just a gallery for whichever servers my Masto admin has blocked.)
- [Pixiv](https://pixiv.me/hikatamika) (To the two people always liking my posts, _y'all want anything from the gas station?_)
- [Pillowfort](https://pillowfort.social/HikaTamika) (Feels kinda dead and I don't like having to reblog my own art to like 5 communities to get 2 likes.)
- [Tumblr](https://hikatamika.tumblr.com/) (Sucks as an OC-main. A habitual crosspost. At least I can poison their AI deals with MidJourney by [Glazing](https://glaze.cs.uchicago.edu/downloads.html) my art to smithereens or whatever.)
- [Threads](https://threads.net/@hikatamika) (Full of people who [rightfully] complain about how trash IG's algorithms are, but have too much going on in Meta's social media ecosystem to feel safe and supported going anywhere else. Defaults to the For You Page, so it's a tough scroll. A crosspost I used to feel obligated to but now idk.)
- [Instagram](https://instagram.com/HikaTamika) (Another semi-obligatory crosspost because it's The Art App to people because it's The Photo App to society as a whole. I'm a chump on there account-size-wise tho. It and Facebook the only places I can keep up with Zine events and Art Markets so at the very least I can't avoid reading IG stories.)
- [TwitterX](https://twitter.com/HikaTamika) (Dead to me. Fired my dad. Garbage site-decisions by Elon. Taken over by paid-verified-bots posing as people and blue-checks with bad opinions that pay their way to the top of the comment roll. Terrible to browse, but is still seen as the text app by society so I habitually crosspost.)

That's 15 sites! Excluding Twitch, which I can't post still images and non-stream videos to anyway, and Ko-Fi, which I count separately.

_**I need to shave that down.**_ Too many! Unsustainable! [Buffer](https://buffer.com/) can (currently) automate 3 of those for me. Mastodon, Twitter, and Instagram. [PostyBirb](https://www.postybirb.com/) can handle Twitter, BlueSky, Mastodon, PixelFed, Pixiv, Pillowfort, and Tumblr for me. That's another 5 excluding repeats.

_**I manually post to 7 places and 2 cross-posting services each time I have something new.**_ That's 9 upload buttons and 9 caption copy-pastes. (Buffer, Postybirb, YouTube, TikTok, Threads, Artfol, CoHost, Inkblot, SheezyArt) _**I want to shave that down and IDK which platforms to put on the chopping block**_. I wish as a community we could all just pick our fave 5 places to post or something. It's hard to choose where to place my efforts. And posting aside, the best way to grow in a community is to give back and enjoy being on it. That's why my BlueSky has a 386-follower-lead on my next "biggest" platform. Ouuughhhh it's so confusing.

Which art site will the community adopt between the Artfol-InkBlot-Sheezy trio? Can CoHost please release their API so someone can code it into PostyBirb üò≠? API for Threads couldn't be here soon enough!!

I'll probably continue to run around in circles. See you all next week!
