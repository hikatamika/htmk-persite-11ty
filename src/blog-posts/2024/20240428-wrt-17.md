[Hidey-howdy-ho,](https://ccsakura.fandom.com/wiki/Cerberus) everyone. It's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing! I'm writing this one in the morning for once. [Strange, isn't it?](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sonic_the_Hedgehog_\(OVA\))

## Art Roundup

This time I actually have something for ya, and you can even [read it here on this very site](https://hikatamika.com/comic/heads-tails-cover/)! Though I cross-posted it to [most of the other ones too](https://hikatamika.com/links/).

![Mini-zine cover of a gloved hand flipping a coin. There are sparkles present. Test says: Heads & Tails.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\HT%20Zine\150\20240419_HTZineWeb-protected-intensity-LOW-V2.png)

It's _[Heads & Tails](https://hikatamika.com/comic/heads-tails-cover/)_, a mini-zine/mini-comic about howâ€¦ the world is very aware of autism and its moreâ€¦ pop-culture represented traits, but isn't very accepting/understanding of the unfavorable traits that often come with it. People seemed toâ€¦ really like it across the web, and some even resonated with its vibes, so that's cool. I probably should have hollered about it on here, but in the meantime, [here's an RSS feed](https://hikatamika.com/comic/feed/) for any paginated comics that'll be posted to this site. I think?

Anyway the printed version that unfolds to reveal the back will be available on my shop, when that's ready. Thanks for reading!

I also made a TikTok video outlining the many places you can find me online [if The TikTok ban goes through seeing as Biden signed it and TikTok has no plans to sell/divest to US ownership, or however the story goes](https://www.npr.org/2024/04/24/1246663779/biden-ban-tiktok-us). You can hear my goofy little voice in it.

## Art Progress

I was very!! Depressed this week continuing on from last week for reasons I'll get briefly get into later but I had fun with a low-effort fan doodle that I'm excitedâ€¦ to mainly post to [Tumblr](https://hikatamika.tumblr.com/), this upcoming week. ðŸ˜† I'll be crossposting it to [my usuals,](https://hikatamika.com/links/) but this one certainly isn't for the masses, lol. It's like, niche-niche. NicheÂ², even. But I think the people it's relevant to will get a kick out of it.

Something about it that'll be a bit different is that it was in a bit of a lower-effort doodle style and I worry that people used to the way my art looks might be thrown off by it. But it was good for the depression, and my lowerâ€¦ effort-span for fanart compared to what I have for OCs.  
Please understand (/Iwata voice)! Thank you. I tossed the sketch for it up onto [my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/i/IK3K4XE5AZ).

Tangentially, May 7th approaches, and that's when I gotta post new video rewards onto [my Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers)! I'll probably do the timelapses & speedpaints for Heads & Tails. That was like, the one arguably impressive thing I did this month that I can show you. Other thingsâ€¦ I can't show you yet.

Gonna shake the funk off so I can do comms and driving lessons this upcoming week, but now I want to tell you about that funk a bit because it's very muchâ€¦ internet related?

## ~~Art~~ Internet Thoughts

Let me tell you, I have the heart and posting spirit of a 300-follower-Andy because that's all I've ever amounted to online for YEARS. _**YEARS.**_ But things changed February of this year when I started being like, more of myself, and more of a sociable person on BlueSky, in a way that continues to amaze me.

![Chart recording my growth along multiple social media sites. My bsky account skyrocketed in March-February, and continues to leave my other sites in the dust.](20240428-01.webp)

_But that "being myself"-thing leading to growth, **also drives my social anxiety through the roof, and my mental health through the floor.**_

People like me and what I have to say for the pleasant parts of being myself. The _Heads_ of Heads & Tails. Especially when I'm being insightful, encouraging, or clever. But toss in some [Mind-Blindness](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_mind), andâ€¦

Anyway. [I've brought it up](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kqz4sfypq32s). I never say anything with intentional cruelty or intentional ignorance, but it happens. And as a person on the internet it's my job to like, apologize, take the L (loss), take the _other_ L (lesson-learned), and improve in my communications going forward, regardless of my neurodivergence.

But after like, being approached by someone who had their (metaphorical) sword antagonistically drawn at me off the jump instead of understanding what I was trying to say (compared to being previously approached by a peer in a different situation just tryna alert me on how what I said can cause harm)â€¦

I dunno! Being myself sucks! I don't like _myself_, much anymore. I like _my art_, but in the era of like, generated-prompt-art, I feel like people online don't follow _art_ they follow _**people** that make art_, but if the same thing that makes people like me makes people mad, _**it makes me not want to be me online anymore**_. It makes me wanna just shut up, post the art and leave. But I fear if I do that, my accounts will stagnate, and if my accounts stagnate, I can't reach my goal of likeâ€¦ making anywhere from a quarter to a half of my living off of art.

I don't know what the answer is, but it feels good to let it out at least. More tone indicators? I don't want to just mute and block people willy-nilly cause it just feels like going "na-nanana-na, I can't hear you!" at people that could be upset with me for a reason, even if the reason is a misunderstanding and they're not getting that I ðŸ‘½come in peace (and occasional mind-blindness)ðŸ‘½ or whatever.

I dunno! I dunno!!! Anyway I wrote this Weekly Roundup Thing early because I wear the "I'm happy, I'm normal" mask a lot even when it's cracked but I wanted to rest and not have to think about writing it in the evening.

See you next week! I have a feeling I'll be happier then. Thanks for reading.
