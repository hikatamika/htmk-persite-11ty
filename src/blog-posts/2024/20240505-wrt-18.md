Weekly Roundup, ya! Hello! (Hello! [Hello! {Hello!}])

Another one I'm writing earlier in the day because I'm eepy. Another tough week, but I'm feeling less down than I've been previous weeks.

## Art Roundup

[![Both a bust, and full figure portrait of Tak and the Power of Juju at a young-adult age in line with Izzy Bubbles‚Äô young adult AU of the Nicktoons Unite series. He looks mostly the same, but has thrifted a shirt from Bikini Bottom, shorts from Amity Park, and Jimmy Neutron has invented highly durable socks for him.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240426_YATak_96-gwm.png)](https://hikatamika.com/portfolio/2024-04-tak/)

SO YEAH. The [Quinton Reviews Nicktoons Unite video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=txy4GF3NYl4)‚Ä¶ it uhhh reawakened a core memory of mine and expanded on it since I only had the first game in the main series, and uhhh‚Ä¶ I drew grown Tak cause no one else does lol. I started this one after my Link Fanart but posted it first because‚Ä¶ the power of funny compelled me, and making it a low-effort doodle helped me finish it quickly, which helped me enjoy myself.

Using the power of effort-assessment, I also managed to draw some little talksprites for video-posting (cause IG is promising improved Reels growth. Again.) I figured if I made some low-effort drawings to help me make low-effort short videos, I'd have more fun (or at least less burnout) doing them.

## Art Progress

I finished!! [The Link drawing](https://ko-fi.com/i/IW7W4WS298) I was trying to do! The non-chibi one. So both the normal one and the chibi one are coming down the upload buffer. I also have more [Nicktoons Unite fanart doodles](https://ko-fi.com/i/IV7V7XJPDW) on the way. (This might be the part where I should remind you that I have [a WIP gallery on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/album/WIPs-J3J7FPONA), idk. The Ko-Fi is just an empty habit at this point.) I figure I can also make image posts out of the graphic design commissions I finished? (YIPPEE! Finished!! Thanks for working with me!)

On Tuesday, speedpaints and timelapses for Heads & Tails will go onto [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers), so hop in if you're curious on my zine/comic process or would like an art buddy to keep your second (or 3rd, or 4th) monitor warm.

This week I'm gonna work on getting the legal paperwork done for the HK‚òÖTMK Shop so I can just go ahead and open it! I feel like I have enough items to launch with, but if I could finish Clay's ref art and launch with the Clay zine that'd be even better tbh.

## Art Thoughts

It's kinda been the ongoing theme through the **Art Roundup** segment, but I feel like for the longest time I've been caught up in the idea that all my art has to look the same/have the same effort put into it, but‚Ä¶ I'm having more fun assessing how much energy I want to invest in specific art ideas and drawing accordingly.

![Full-body illustration of Lux Pink](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2023\20230609_Pink_150B-gwm.png)

![My original character, a blue, hijabi, magical hero, marching with a Palestinian flag. Olive branches hang from a tree. Text says: Free Palestine, Defund Genocide, Ceasefire Now](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240219_NX%20Indg%20Final%20Crop%2096-gwm.png)

Like lemme be honest for a sec, my usual "good pieces", take long. This Lux Pink? 17.6hrs. This Nox Indigo? 19hrs. The power of pure OC obsession helps it feel like nothing, but it sure is a lot. There's no wayyyyy I'd be able to pour that same amount of effort into fanart, even of things I really-super-duper like, because the brainrot is not on my side with those. Hence, the doodle-style which I'm working to build. And why this week's Tak drawing looks nothing like my usual.

It all clicked then I watched this YouTube video on creative burnout. It's spoken through the lens of video editing, but I assure you, whatever type of creative you are, the point will make sense. ‚¨áÔ∏è

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DXh8Efdsgjc

It's all about the effort/reward balance. I can pour _**tons**_ of effort into OC art because‚Ä¶ it makes me personally happy and fulfilled, _Reward #1_, and it means art of my OCs get to exist (let's be real I'll always be the main person that draws them), that's _Reward #2_.

The video describes creative burnout as something that happens when creative effort outweighs the reward. So‚Ä¶ I've found that low-effort fanart doesn't burn me out! And is actually enjoyable! I just need to put in the smallest amount of effort needed to execute funny fanart ideas I find entertaining, and that's the reward.

_**All that being said‚Ä¶**_

I think it's unsustainable of me to be spending upwards of 12hrs on big OC pieces regardless so I'm gonna try to fix my speed on those too. Like I think that's just me being a slow artist‚Ä¶ that's just my fault. I already use an auto time-tracker for my creative work, _and_ record art process footage so I'm going to be taking a closer look at my steps and seeing what I can do to speed things up.

Some ideas include‚Ä¶

- Having a second, print-size view of my canvas on my second monitor. (I waste so much time zooming in and out!)
- Better layer management/less layers overall.
- Low-Fidelity sketching. Actively _drawing_ in the ink phase instead of just tracing a perfectly detailed sketch.
- Less undo. Especially in the sketch phase, like who cares at that point.
- Not (fully) drawing anatomy that's gonna be hidden.
- Daydreaming before drawing more instead of actively figuring out what I want to draw directly on the page.

So expect a quality-rollercoaster going forward. üò¨‚úåÔ∏è
