This week I posted the drawing of Link I'd recently finished!! I, uh, honestly expected this one to do better off-Bluesky than on, but‚Ä¶ it kinda trickled and plinked on most places and then splashed on Bluesky. üßç Is this how people find theirselves locked into one platform? The platform where people actually see and care about what you're up to? Ughh it feels weird and fatalistic thinking about it tbh. **_NEXT!!_**

For short-form videos I have moved to an editing style that's quick to put together using some of the assets I made last week along with some new ones too. This editing style is so easy for me, in fact, that the video is about how shocked I was that my Tak drawing had more (consistent) engagement than my Link one. Harr-harr‚Ä¶

Talk-sprites and text. Treating the art as the B-roll and not the main plot. I talk about it a bit more in [this thread](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3kryy42onu22r) (that I crossposted). If reading is lame, zepn1 [posted a video about it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4a3_vadedho) that coincidentally goes over a lot of the same points. They're actually a big part of why I made talksprites for myself. The editing, Mr. Beast subtitles, and voiceovers I was doing beforehand were too much for the way the algo was treating me tbh, lol.

## Art Progress

I‚Ä¶!! Still need to do that shop paperwork. Also!! I am nervous about FanimeCon. And I'm upset about interpersonal stuff, so vent-art kinda skipped its way to the top of my work queue. Luckily I don't owe anybody work right now so this only affects myself. Har-har-har!! [I put a WIP onto Ko-Fi.](https://ko-fi.com/i/IV7V5XX55P)

I made a bunch of short-form videos to trickle out now that I have a new appealing-but-low-effort editing style for those. Remember! [Match the effort to the reward,](https://hikatamika.com/2024/05/12/weekly-roundup-thing-19/) and those short video platforms do not reward me much, so quantity over quality baybeeeeeeee‚Ä¶

This upcoming week I'll post my [Nicktoons Unite doodle](https://ko-fi.com/i/IV7V7XJPDW) and one (or two?) of the short-form videos I have on queue while working on the stuff that takes longer. AND‚Ä¶ doing that shop paperwork. FOR REAL THIS TIME‚Ä¶

## Art Thoughts

Y'all know I've been a 300-Follower Andy for years only to have my random-breakout-growth-moment on BlueSky, yeah? (Lowkey it's becoming solidified as my main, whether I like it or not seeing the gap in how much this weeks art was seen on there compared to my other places.) Well, like, one of the things I hoped I'd be capable of after having a random-breakout-growth-moment is being able to put eyes on other people's work. Paying it forward and all that. I think waiting for algorithms to pick up you and your peers is waiting forever. So I choose to üîÅboostüîÅ work I like while I'm scrolling, in hopes that other people will engage with it, yeah?

So why does a Pinterest napkin scribble gesture drawing I did have 44 likes when artists I've reblogged make finished drawings and struggle to get like ten or fifteen? üíÄüíÄüíÄ I don't like it, lol. It doesn't make sense to me. I wish people engaged more with art posts I share from other people. I feel like with the eyes I've gained on my account I should be able to help people more. Why isn't it working?? Like in my head, my gut thought is, "stop liking my garbage sketches!!!" But, I know instead of like, blaming people for _enjoying my doodles,_ I should moreso just ask like‚Ä¶ _**why not the art I boost, too?**_

I wouldn't make my profile a rebloggy mess on there if I didn't think it'd help people out. _**Why isn't it helping people out‚Ä¶?**_ Does anyone have any ideas on how I can better encourage people following me to check out other artists I've found? Cause I guess just reblogging their work isn't enough.

I was thinking maybe Artist Spotlight Threads? Would that be too unnatural/forced? IDK.

That's really my only art thought for this week. I reblog to make ü´µyourü´µ timeline cooler. Go engage (pwease? ü•∫).

Before I leave ya for the week, have you checked out the (not so new, now) [Media](https://hikatamika.com/media/) page on here? It's where all the fun stuff that doesn't fit the galleries will go. Check it out. There are comics inside. Though, if you read this blog, you've probably read them already.
