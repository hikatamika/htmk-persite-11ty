A slow-blinking, dissociative, Happy Weekly Roundup Thing to you. This week was a good one actually, I'm just scared of the next one!

## Art Roundup

![](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240429_SpongeDan_96-gwm.png)

This week's art post wasâ€¦ this doodle of Danny (Fenton) and SpongeBob, done in [IzzyBubbles'](https://x.com/izbubbles) AU designs. Izzy was kind enough to share my posts on ~~Twitter~~ [X](https://x.com/HikaTamika/status/1790389154557087881/) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/p/C68-541RKD1/)!! Which means a lot because they're more-or-less leading the Nicktoons Unite nostalgia movementâ„¢. And uh, honestly that was the most spotlight I've ever had on a ~~drawing~~ doodle, to my recollection. I'm very grateful.

[Just last week I was wondering](https://hikatamika.com/2024/05/12/weekly-roundup-thing-19/) why it felt like my reblogs on BlueSky (my highest follower count at 700) didn't seem to be helping people all that much. It's causeâ€¦ _**In the grand scheme of things that's still baby-numbers, I guess!!**_ â€¦which is wild to me because if I was put into a closed room with 700 people I'd probably evaporate and die.

I hope I can overthrow the algorithms with reblogs one day but I am not there yet. _That reminds me,_

_**I got onto the Instagram Search/Explore Page for the first time today,**_ which is the core way for an image post on IG to get discovered by non-followersâ€¦ And it's blocked off by a "this post must blow up **this much** to appear" metric. Cool that I got on there, but would it kill Zuck and Mosseri to just put recent hashtag search back up? Get some slow-growth, trickling discovery back on there? Please? No? Alright.

I made like, six last week short verticals and posted [two of them](https://youtube.com/@hikaTamika/shorts) this week, that did way better than my usual ones. Thank God.

Izzy's help from my image post carried over to the [Reels](https://www.instagram.com/hikatamika/reels/) ports, which was nice too! [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika) doesn't give a hoot about me like usual.

Treating short vids like another yap-medium is turning out really effective. When my speedpaints/art _were_ the whole TikTok, no one watched to the end. But now that the Tok('s main point) is me _**yapping about something**_ (in text form) with the speedpaint as the B-roll, people stick around to see what the full yap is, giving me the watch-time I need for algorithms to not kick me to the curb. Also I can make the darned videos faster cause it's just putting on the text. Skits/trends and stuff take too long.

## Art Progress

In addition to the TikToks I made _last_ week, I made another 4? This week, and wrote some other ones that need background footage. I also fought with coloring, a LOT. I am a monochrome soulâ€¦ but I'd like to get good at coloring, cause having good coloring skills is like having satisfying keys to jingle in front of the cones in people's eye-cells or whatever.

The good thing about all this is I have a month's worth of stuff to sprinkle out if going to con kills me. Hooray for content calendars!

I am lowkey dreading the fact that my art post for next week won't do as good as Danny & SpongeBob. More work went into itâ€¦ [but it's an OC piece](https://ko-fi.com/i/IV7V5XX55P)â€¦ and there'll be no reblog power involved this timeâ€¦ URK!!!

A few days into the week I was filled with an overwhelming sense of trauma-induced dread and ðŸ’…I did not do my shop paperworkðŸ’…. Since my one-and-only CSP license is on my desktop-PC and not my laptop (that I'm taking with me), I'll probably do the paperwork this upcoming week at con.

Once con is over I can move forward with life stuff and shop stuff too!!! ARRRGHHHâ€¦ Oh oh that reminds me! _**My Vtuber is finished!!**_ I'll make streams and video content with it for you all soon. I'm excited to use it. My brain is just soggy and overwhelmed rn.

## Life Thoughts

Y'know, Somethingâ„¢ happened to me in college that changed me from someone who's Authentically Myselfâ„¢ to a terrified People Pleaserâ„¢ till death who's deathly afraid of being annoying. After the pandemic my social skills and neurodivergent masking skills rotted away. Then I built those back when I got hired, then they started dying again when I got laid off.

_**And now I'm going to an anime convention?! In the city where the Somethingâ„¢ from college happened?! With the people related to the Somethingâ„¢?!**_ How goofy am Iâ€¦

I'm not sure if [Fidget Cubes](https://www.antsylabs.com/products/fidget-cube-the-original-fidget-toy), [Loop Earplugs](https://www.loopearplugs.com/), and noise cancelling headphones will get me out of this one alive or not (not sponsored btw,), but I'm in too deep to back out at this point. Taught myself the ASL for _yes, no, thank you, sorry,_ and _excuse me_ just in case I lose speech or something. Lessee what happens! ðŸ’€

## Art Thoughts

I'd written notes for what I wanted to talk about in this week's Art Thoughts segment. TikTok strategies that work for meâ€¦ but I already did that this week and [a bit of last week](https://hikatamika.com/2024/05/12/weekly-roundup-thing-19/). I wanted to speak on the power of fanart and how RTing art you think is nice helps, just that the help is just more obvious the bigger the account isâ€¦ talked about that already. And, the dread that occurs when you feel like your next art piece won't meet the reception of the previous one. Did that already too.

I think I'll just let y'all be. I don't feel my best right now anyway. But I can expand on those things more later if I think of anything else to say. See ya, alright?
