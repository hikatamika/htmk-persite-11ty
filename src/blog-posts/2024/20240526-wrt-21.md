A happy Weekly Roundup Thing to you, from the South Bay! I am tucking out of FanimeCon early to deliver this roundup unto you.

## Art Roundup

This week I posted _Stairway to Heaven,_ which was a vent piece about still beingâ€¦ hurt, and damaged, and stuck where you are, despite the people that put you there having moved on.  
_But it looks cool and that's all that matters._ ðŸ˜Œ People seemed to really like it (on BSky at least. Which is more or less my "they really liked it" gauge at this point)!! Thanks for that!! Though the coloring & shading department took _for**ever**_ (I gotta re-tool my coloring process), I enjoyed like, turning feelings into a piece with an OC, and like, a background, and themed elements, and I hope to do that again soon.

The week's short videos are as follows:

This one was an old one from when I used to edit my videos a LOT and I mean a LOTâ€¦ Like I went to Adobe After Effects for this oneâ€¦ which I am in no hurry to do again unless one of these platforms starts paying me for it honestly. **_But!!_** People on IG reels really liked it!! So thanks for that! I'm not above doing more tip videos in the futureâ€¦ just with simpler editing!

Next is this one, which did quite nicely most places, but YouTube Shorts **_really_** liked it. Like 7k views, 670 likes, liked it. Which is like, never-before-heard of numbers for me, thank you. If any artist reading this takes anything from this, I just want it to be that:

1. The effort can be quite low
2. YouTube Shorts is generous with the views!! And there's an audience there! You might be like "really?" cause you don't use it (I don't much either) but there are people out there that seem to be using it!

Anyway, next!!

## Art Progress

Bro I did not drawâ€¦ a thing. In an upload-y sense, anyway! All the stuff I have for you next week is buffer stuff I've drawn ahead of time. Like food in a cooking TV show. I definitely needed that cause FanimeCon was a lot. In good ways, in tiring ways, but I'll talk to you about it in a non-roundup blog maybeeee sometime this week!

## Art Thoughts

This week's thought, especially being at Fanime for the past three days, is like, _"I'm readyâ€¦"_. Funny, seeing as I posted [art of Spongebob (& Danny!!)](https://hikatamika.com/2024/05/26/weekly-roundup-thing-21/) last week!

What I mean though is, like, walking around Artist Alley & Dealers Hall, I didn't see the people tabling as like majorly, distant, far-off, or separated from me art wise. **_I bring this up,_** because it probably won't be long before I _hum and haw_ and think to myself that I'll be ready to be _An Artistâ„¢_ or _Make Comicsâ„¢_ or _Sell Goodsâ„¢_ after I manage to do XYZ thing, but, we've only got so much time on earthâ€¦ and everyone's gotta start somewhere! So, learn on the jobâ€¦ by doing!!

I just wish I could be a little bit more about fanart thoughâ€¦ It's so hard! I have OC-itis!!

See you next week!
