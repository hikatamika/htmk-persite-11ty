Ello, ello! It's time for yet another Weekly Roundup Thing. This one's quite late in the evening. I feel like I'm always doing a lot, and thinking a lot. Sorry. Before I get into it, lemme admit that my little FanimeCon 2024 recap and thoughts got away from me this week, but I still wanna write it. Maybe this upcoming week!

## Art Roundup

[![Digital ink drawing. A young person with long parted fringe and a short ponytail looks up and to the side.](D:\Users\hikad\Pictures\Art%20Posts\Gallery\2024\20240507_MGRiley_720p-gwm.png)](https://hikatamika.com/portfolio/2024-05-mg-riley/)

This week I uploaded a drawing of one of my OCs I AU'd for the tabletop RPG, [Moongrave](https://weregazelle.itch.io/moongrave). I drew it ahead of time cause I figured I'd be dead tired after the convention. And I was right! _**I was tired!**_

Anyway, I added some shitpost doodles I did of them between RPG turns onto places like [IG](https://www.instagram.com/p/C7hFtwzRAWr/) and [Threads](https://www.threads.net/@hikatamika/post/C7hFbB1Rn06) because on those, the shitposts don't clog up a media tab or whatever. (That is to say I still think Meta is stinky. I just get self-conscious about the fact that I don't draw skilled & appealing stuff 100% of the time. Especially when going fast.)

This week I posted 3 short videos so that I'll make my Instagram-mandated 10-Reels-A-Month-Quota. TikTok, did not care. IG, did not care much either. But love of my life, the [YouTube Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/@HikaTamika) algorithm went _**wild**_ for this one, which I will share with you. I was just trying to showcase a timelase in a funny way while yapping about stuff we could all relate to.

If you think [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika) and [IG Reels](https://www.instagram.com/hikatamika/reels/) are the better video apps, I dare you to prove it byyyyyyy following ya boi?? ü•∫ Engaging so my posts don't get Thanos-snapped? IDK!

## Art Progress

My backlog of 75% finished projects continues to pile up‚Ä¶

This week I was feeling really inspired by Artist Alley and the few OC-centric artists I saw selling their OC-wares there, that I decided to start pairing my future webcomic OCs with general-appeal aesthetics and activities that come from whatever I already had written/designed for them. Hopefully I can make designs/products people like, and attach people to my OCs, while continuing to chip away at my comic outlines.

I feel like I still owe y'all another Astra*Mix Minis entry among other things‚Ä¶ I allowed myself to be dead for a week post-Fanime‚Ä¶ now it's time to get my butt in gear!! Thank goodness I have art and TikToks piled up or whatever, y'feel me!! Sheesh!

## Art Thoughts

[Cara, Cara Cara‚Ä¶ _I have one now!_](https://cara.app/hikatamika) Cause Zuck and Mosseri finally did enough to make artists mad ([piling their art into the AI machine](https://petapixel.com/2024/05/14/meta-is-using-your-instagram-photos-to-train-its-amazing-ai-image-generator/)). My question is, what does [Elon have to do](https://www.businessinsider.comelon-musk-x-to-use-public-information-trains-ai-models-2023-9/?op=1) to get y'all to feel the same way about Twitter/X? He's already done like, tons of politically incorrect stuff, _**and**_ made terrible UI/UX changes, so like, what more will it take‚Ä¶ [bro has already drank the AI Kool-Aid](https://www.businessinsider.comelon-musk-x-to-use-public-information-trains-ai-models-2023-9/?op=1)‚Ä¶ he's training on our stuff.

_**Gimme like 30min in his body and I'll make him tweet that he eats babies. That'll do it for sure.**_

Anyway as I was saying, [I have a Cara](https://cara.app/hikatamika). And if I keep crossposting the way I've _**been**_ crossposting, it'd be the 17th or 18th site [on my crossposting rounds](https://hikatamika.com/my-links/). So, I have to make a change!

_**I'm pausing activity on my [PixelFed](https://pixelfed.social/HikaTamika), [Pillowfort](https://www.pillowfort.social/HikaTamika), [Inkblot](https://inkblot.art/profile/hikatamika), and potentially, [Artfol](https://www.artfol.co/hikatamika) accounts.**_ I'm here-or-there on Artfol, cause while I vastly prefer SheezyArt (and have an account there), the current limited signups add friction to anyone hoping to make an account there to engage with me. So, my Artfol is like an open Sheezy alternative. We'll see. I'm curious about how the public will react to the Artfol 2.0 update they wanna do.

_**This brings my cross-posting efforts from 17 sites down to 13.**_

All these sites I'm pausing have natural discoverability issues. I think people aren't searching for the tags I post to, or browsing tags at all. Some of them, like **Pillowfort** and **Inkblot** have UX/UI things that make them unenjoyable for me to use. Some of them, like **Artfol** are just, good platforms that the culture (at large) is just, _ignoring_ right now. **PixelFed**, just, no one cares what I'm doing on there, and I only crosspost to it cause my [Mastodon](https://mastodon.art/@HikaTamika) admin blocks servers freely. They all have their dedicated userbases, which makes me feel bad for pausing because I feel if I made an effort to _interact_ with those cult-followings I could do well there, but it's a bit of a big ask when I'm also _crossposting_ to a ton of places _and_ blooming/growing well on some with less effort.

Effort must = benefit/reward; lest one suffer from burnout and all that.

Anyway, so 13 sites, yeah? Once Buffer adds Threads and BlueSky support, I'll use it for those (among sites I already use it for) which can bring my efforts down to 9, then PostyBirb can bring it down to an even lower 8, assuming it doesn't get new website additions between now and the next update (the lead developer isn't feeling well right now).

To further alleviate my stress, I'll post doodles individually to microblogging sites and sites with algorithmic post quotas, but everywhere else I'll only post illustrations solo; compiling doodles into doodle logs instead. Should save me even more headache.

The less sites I feel like I gotta post to frequently, the better‚Ä¶!! AAAA!! I this week I read some BSky posts about multi-platform-presence that made me feel a bit better about slowing my roll, so it's been on my mind.

I'm blessed to be in communication with smart and thoughtful people!

But that's all for now, I'll see you next week!
