Oh noâ€¦ my social media fatigue is increasing. But, it's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing!

That reminds me, [I have a longer version of my links page](https://hikatamika.com/my-links/) (the me-centric one) with all the sites I've posted to (to my recollection), dead or active, chatty or lurking, with a short blurb on how I feel about each one.

## Art Roundup

This week, I posted this doodle of my friend's OC (from the tabletop campaign I'm playing!). Which, I think I went too fast on, but I've been wanting more "result" and less "process" out of my art latelyâ€¦ _**(I wanna be fast!!!)**_ Manâ€¦ ðŸ˜¥

In keeping with [IG reels](https://www.instagram.com/hikatamika/reels/)' 10 reels a month recommendation (on it, and [Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC8a7oId-TjDTbiHNt1ijgKA) & [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika)), I uploaded 3 short videos this week. Once again though, [Danny and SpongeBob](https://www.tumblr.com/hikatamika/750491306560831488/every-depressed-guy-gets-a-neutron-mandated) are carrying me. Oops. The mixed feeling of loving Nicktoons Unite, but feeling sad that my OCs don't do well on the big platforms.

## Art Progress

Rapid-fire updates, _**go!**_

I'm late on June's [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika) video, but the good thing is, no one subscribes to me on there yet, so I'm not letting anybody down! I'll holler on [my microblogging platforms](https://hikatamika.com/my-links/#sec-microblogging) and Ko-Fi itself when it's done.

I've got OC prints and sticker sheets on the brain. I figure if I draw them in aesthetics and with items that people like, they can enjoy the art for that without having to like my OCs.

Lately I've been kinda mad at myself because I don't like the amount of figure construction I need to draw characters? It makes me grumpy, lol. I just want the idea to _**COME OUT!!**_ I don't like having to build figures from the ground up.

The summer sun has turned me a bit sloth-like, but I still need to get my shop paperwork done grrrr grrrr!! Maybe I'll become more of a morning person to offset the problem.

## Art Thoughts

As an Internet Nativeâ„¢, I feel like a lot of my "mind" lies in the Internet. For example, sometimes I use microblogging as a crutch to process my thoughts, or scrolling to seek inspiration. This week I've taken a step back and started reading/seeking out artbooks more (as like, controlled "gourmet", relevant inspiration), and doing short-form (paper) journaling to sit back and listen to my own thoughts a bit. Not every thought needs to be a ~~skeeâ€”~~ _post!!_

_**And it's felt really good!**_ I got a lot of sketching done this week! ([1](https://bsky.app/hashtag/Sketch?author=hikatamika.com), [2](https://bsky.app/hashtag/ArtPractice?author=hikatamika.com)) That said, how _**good**_ unplugging feels, worries me. I feel like I'm a better artist when I unplug my brain for a good amount of time each day. Potentially even, for the _**majority**_ of each day. But social media has become such a core factor in artist success. Add in the Twitter and Instagram diasporas and their cause for a need to crosspost, and I feel like I need to make a difficult choice. Do I "be online" (like all the time and crosspost everywhere), or "be offline" (spending time in my own head, and being easygoing with my crossposting; focusing my "active/on-time/regular" posts to the platforms where I feel community and the algos [or lack thereof] treat me right)?

A big way I've been feeling this problem is in challenging myself to follow Insta's 10 reels a month recommendation. _**I'm 3/4 weeks in and I'm already tired of it.**_ But video is the exposure king and the engagement king if you do it right. The problem is "doing it right" is a formula obscured by the black-box algorithm. 2-3 toks a week isn't doing much for my online engagement and it's making me tired. Very tired. The videos themselves feel lower quality too.

When I have time to cook, be by myself, and think for myself, _**the art comes out better.**_ I create more, develop and feel myself improve. But is that an act of _self-sabotage in our current social me_dia landscape?

_**I dunno! You tell me!**_
