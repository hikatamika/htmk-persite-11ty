_**Screeeeeech…**_ What's that rancid smell, like burnt tire tubber? Burnout? Weekly Roundup Thing?

## Art Roundup

No illustrations this week. Quite a few sketches in my sketchbook, but those aren't Posts™.

---

I just finished doing 10 Reels (and Toks, and Shorts) a month on Friday, like Instagram had asked me to, by posting 3 more this week. They're where you'd expect to find them (Reels, TikTok, Shorts). But nothing good happened to my account like what was implied, and I crashed, and burned hard.

Here's the final one.

I'll talk more about this, in a minute.

## Art Progress

I'm reassessing the projects that matter to me and taking them one at a time. I got busy with life stuff and freelance this week, unfortunately, so I only had time to squeeze in those three videos.

![Aladdin smear frame "skate or die" meme. Skate or die, dude. You either skate or you die.](20240616-01.jpg)

It's post or die, dude. You either post, or you die.

## Art Thoughts

I'm so tired. So tired! 10 Reels (& Toks & Shorts) a month was probably a terrible idea. But I just wanted to feel like I was giving The People's Preferred Apps a solid chance. The good ol' college try, if you will. Like if I actively put in the labor into the apps everyone says we should remain on, _focus on,_ things would work. But there's no room for me in their algorithms. At all. I'm convinced by the metaphorical blood/sweat/tears I've already shed. Image or Video. Even before trying to put out 10 into a month, even when I was just trying to post twice a week. Outside of that one time I was boosted by a mega account, my posts were as good as garbage on The People's Apps despite being like, celebrated on BlueSky, SheezyArt, etc.

Real Monkey's Paw moment being celebrated on the app(s) The Majority of Normal People in Our Society don't care about(*), I guess.

The People's Platforms™ are already profitable. They have enough monthly active users and enticing, popular accounts to get people to sit and scroll through ads. They can shed the kinder algorithms they used to need to attract enough creators to get consumers to sit through advertisements. _**Their algorithms exist to make you sit on the app**_ _(through ads)_ _**longer, and they figure they already have enough big accounts to push at you to make sure that happens.**_

And it feels like I'm being told that I should keep routinely posting to these sites that treat my work like trash and I should just expect and embrace that outcome. Because of the resources/venture capital these companies have, for the success and livelihoods of the people on these platforms that've already made it and escaped the algorithm (the maintenance of their existing livelihoods matters more than me and others being able to obtain creative livelihoods in the first place), and to just stay with the persistence and passion that casual users have for their beloved hellsites.

And I dunno, I don't want to. Even if that's objectively wrong. My subjective experience just makes me not want to. Especially when things have been **_nice_** for me and my work on BlueSky, Cara, SheezyArt, even Mastodon after instance-hopping. If there's one good thing about the fact that it's too late for me to naturally make it as an artist on TikTok/IG/Twitter, it's that I'm not ruining my chances any _more_ by posting onto my Silly Little Websites No One Cares About™, there were just no more chances for me on The Big Sites That Matter™ in the first place.

## What's Next?

- Probably gonna bugger off for a while, recharge my creative spirit with rest and media, and never actively spend it where it kills me ever again. Gonna automate my posting to TikTok/IG/Twitter so I don't even have to think about it much. I can ignore them just as much as they ignore me.
- Prolly just gonna make videos for YouTube Shorts (the one short video platform that doesn't hate my guts) when I feel like it, and crosspost the finished videos to IG Web and TikTok Web, even if it deranks my posts to not use embedded sound/text/whatever. Been using those properly for a little under 2 years and nothing has changed anyway.
- No more creating short vids for short vids' sake. Again, wasted effort I've _been_ making this whole time anyway. Woe, repurposed auto-timelapses and video clips from stream/longform videos be upon ye. They'd get treated with the same lack of care from the algorithm anyway.
- Tangential but potentially removing TikTok and IG from my phone. Unenjoyable apps for me even as a consumer. Feels like it exists just to administer quick laughs or dopamine shots and I don't even like those most of the time, be they on my FYP or sent to me by others. I want to be deeply intrigued/inspired/informed or nothing. These little dopamine bites do nothing for me and I'm tired of pretending they do for social reasons. The web portals for these apps are there anyway if I really need to do something.

Bye-bye!
