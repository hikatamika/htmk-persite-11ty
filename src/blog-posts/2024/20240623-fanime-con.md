## A Brief FanimeCon 2024 Review

FanimeCon… felt kinda alright for (MY) first con back after being gone since COVID (my last visit was Fanime 2019. Fanime had 2023 and 2022, I just didn't go.) Something felt, off and different since the last time I'd been, though. And I wouldn't be able to properly describe it to you, even if I tried. So, instead, I'll direct you to the homepage for the [#FailedByFanime](https://failedbyfanime.com/) movement. TL;DR there are problems with attendee safety, and creeps being on staff despite being reported, along with money/tax issues, a lack of an Accessibility Department, and poor treatment and compensation of staff. [I implore you to go take a look at their website](https://failedbyfanime.com/).

That said…!

Though I didn't catch anything, ***I wish they kept the mask mandate up***, had maximum room occupancies, and did things to prevent like, crowding & hanging around in the main hallway. If not for COVID, for flu or con-crud, at least? I also felt like the dining spaces in the main hallway and Dealers' Hall had people sat together too close. Like, if it weren't for my dad's box of KN-95s I would have been breathing strangers' hot breath for sure. There was no floor tape in the registration line or anything like that either, like, the way the con was managed had very "COVID's over, protect yourself if you want" vibes, and I didn't like that.

Artist Alley was a rough shopping experience. The flow of movement was just… bad. People standing around in the aisles & whatnot… I feel like people sitting on the sides for too long should be discouraged, and that there should be ***maximum*** *(non-staff, non-artist & non-helper)* ***occupancy***. A customer exits AA, another one is let in. Something like that. Tbh it may have not been that different in 2019, and it's just that my sensory tolerance went down, but still. Like, I don't think the overcrowding does anything to help the people vending, cause it caused me to skip tables I would have shopped at otherwise.

I wish there were more panels, but I can't blame people, what with the [#FailedByFanime movement](https://failedbyfanime.com/). (If I hadn't had preordered my ticket as soon as they went up, I probably wouldn't have been this year, tbh.) I think Fanime needs to take more advantage of the rising amount of anime & manga inspired creators and make more panels on indie animation and comics. There were 2 on comics this year. Give me more! But also, give me some more intermediate ones. I feel like the one I was able to go to was very… beginners-of-beginners and, with the amount of information freely available online, I'd like to see more creative panels than just beginner panels, or, panels made to give a little something to people of all experience levels.

My area of solace was the manga lounge. I was very happy to see lots of hand sanitizer around, but they needed ***bigger and better signage that the area was meant to be a low volume space***. A small, 12pt font line on a rules list board won't do. Such a rule deserves a sign to itself, with custom chibi art of one of the mascots shooshing, and "Keep Your Voices Down" in big bold font. My space to regulate from the sensory overwhelm of con became a source of sensory overwhem itself when people were waiting for some panel or other area of con to open up, and that's bad. Give the sensory-avoidant neurodivergents (me) a place to cool off.

## My Artist Alley Experience, Fandom-wise

Hoo boy, was there a big difference between my experience this year, and the last year I went. (FanimeCon 2019). In 2019 I was into so many things that were popular in the space at the time. BTS, Mob Psycho 100, CardCaptor Sakura (had a resurgence due to Clear Card Arc), Pop Team Epic, Demon Slayer… Some webcomic artists I liked had tables too, so it was fun to support them and get merchandise of their OCs!

Dawg, it's no one's fault or anything this year but I felt so out of it. I… do not care about Genshin. The only character I like from Honkai Star Rail is Boothill, and I don't even consume any content from that game unless it involves him. All the VTuber agencies with their IdolTubers… HoloLive, VShoujo, NijiSanji and the rest: not for me, respectfully. I haven't fully sunken my teeth into either version of Dungeon Meshi yet. My friend just recently managed to successfully get me into Omniscient Reader's Viewpoint *post-*con, so it meant nothing to me while I was there. (Means quite a bit to me now! Shoulda gotten into it sooner, lol.)

I was able to get some loot of stuff I liked, but I felt really off-the-pulse this year. But those feelings were cleared, and my spirit was lifted, when I found tables OC items… OC sections, or even the rare majority-OC table. 😭✨

***The power of OC-items?*** I can buy them without feeling like a fake fan, lol. I can just buy them cause I think the art is neat. I don't have to name 7 different runs of *Batman*, I can just think the character's cool looking and buy the merch, and if there ***is*** some kind of webcomic or indie animation attached to the character, the barrier to entry often feels lighter, and I can just go home and consume the content right after con.

I think the most powerful thing I learned is that, any OC is marketable as long as you can pair them with a good/trendy/relatable aesthetic. The OC becomes a vehicle for the aesthetic or motif, people get curious about the character, people get attached to the character, ???, ***SUCCESS!!***

I've already started thinking about what aesthetics and motifs I can pair my characters with for prints and sticker sheets, tbh. Just, y'know. Gimme a minute.

Another thing I like about Artist Alley is the more human interactions I have with the artists. It just feels way more person-to-person than the person-with-smaller-numbers-(me)-to-person-with-bigger-numbers-(you) interactions I have online. Maybe I'd do a better job promoting my work IRL… and I'd feel less like a little gnat.

And yeah, that's how the few OC merch artists in a sea of fanart merch artists made me feel like I could be a little OC merch artist too.

And that's my Fanime 2024 recap. Sorry it took a month!
