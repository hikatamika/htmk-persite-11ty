A weary, but alright "Happy Weekly Roundup Thing" to you! I've been healing from Social Media grind burnout, not that I hope to return to the (full) grind, anytime soon.

## Art Roundup

![A cropped preview of my gallery page, showing four images.](20240623-01.webp)

No new finished art pieces this week, but I'd like to introduce my revamped [Art](https://hikatamika.com/art-gallery/) and [Design](https://hikatamika.com/design-gallery/) galleries to you all! The canonical backlog of most of the art I've uploaded online (that I still think holds merit in some way). The best parts? You can subscribe to it by [RSS](https://hikatamika.com/portfolio/feed/) _**and**_ each piece _links to everywhere I've posted it on social media_, so you can go and interact with my art on the websites you prefer. Check it out!

I also did the [Decade Art Improvement Meme, which has its own blogpost entry here](https://hikatamika.com/2024/06/22/decade-meme-%e7%b5%b5%e6%9f%84%e5%a4%89%e9%81%b7%e5%b9%b4%e8%a1%a8/), since I didn't want to toss it into the gallery.

I [sketched something today](https://ko-fi.com/i/IC1C0ZOLC2) that IDK if I'm gonna turn it into a finished piece or not. So into the [Ko-Fi sketch gallery](https://ko-fi.com/album/Sketches-A0A8PDOPV) it goes. There's a [WIP for Clay's reference sheet](https://ko-fi.com/i/IO5O7ZKY4N) in the [Ko-Fi WIP gallery](https://ko-fi.com/album/WIPs-J3J7FPONA) as well.

On Friday, [I played Pajama Sam 3 on Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/hikatamika/) to test my new VTuber (made by the amazing [VLightning](https://vlightning.carrd.co/)) on my old stream setup. Things went smoothly (maybe because of my new graphics card?) so expect more streams in the future. Unfortunately: don't expect a set schedule, _**yet**_!! [So go follow](https://www.twitch.tv/hikatamika/) if you don't want to miss out.

Don't fret though, cause all game VODs [will be freely available on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HikaTamikaVODs), and art VODs, or their specific drawing footage [will be made available to Ko-Fi members](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/tiers).

**Edit:** OH YEAH!! Also, June's Ko-Fi rewards are up! They're for the Stairway to Heaven piece, [so they're linked under it, here](https://hikatamika.com/portfolio/2024-05-stairway-to-heaven/). Go look!

## Art Progress

I've been freely sketching… trying to convince myself I can. Working on [a reference sheet for Clay](https://ko-fi.com/i/IO5O7ZKY4N). Not for ArtFight or anything, as I think I wanna focus on my own projects more, going forward. I'm running out of time, y'see.

## Art Thoughts

Lately, especially with X and Insta happenings, I've been wary of putting my faith and "weight" into Social Media sites. Like, leaning into them too hard. Even if they're sites I really enjoy! Like [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com), and [Mastodon](https://mastoart.social/@hikatamika) (which I've been enjoying more lately now that I've found a server with moderation policies I like).

**I'd like to pivot into promoting my website more, and having an email/RSS newsletter, tbh.** So I'll be working on that. It's hard though. Ideally I'd like Social Media to be where people interact with me, and my website to be where people can like, smoothly and seamlessly enjoy my backlog of work, but I feel like people don't like personal websites anymore. Platforms, platforms, platforms. They wanna consume their favorite people's work through apps and platforms. I still think the newsletter'll be worth a shot, though! It'll be monthly and actually replace the Weekly Roundup Things, cause I'm feeling like asking people that like me to visit my custom website weekly is genuinely too big of an ask, in 2024. Once a month seems more fair.

This upcoming Wednesday, all our Meta Product (Instagram, Facebook, Threads & co.) text and images will belong to Meta and Meta AI… I'm not so stingy about my blabber text (my narrative writing, yes, my internet-posting text, no), but my images matter to me. _**I'm not gonna be uploading my digital art PNGs to Meta products for a bit** while I see if either backlash, or government regulation fixes things._ There's a chance neither ever will, at which point I'll just stop using Meta products altogether. If you're a Meta-App-only Hika enjoyer reading this, 1) congrats for making it here! 2) Please [cross-follow me on at least one non-Meta product of your choosing](https://hikatamika.com/my-links/).

All that to say, on Meta products, expect the occasional Story, Reel, angled phone photo of my display tablet, angled phone photo of my sketchbook, or product photo with Glaze, Nightshade, and watermarks to the nines unless Zuck and Mosseri decide to have some respect for the people that give their products value.

…and I think that's all, for now! Thanks for reading, as always. And see you next week! I plan to start my newsletter on July 7th, so we've got a few more Weekly Roundup Things to go.
