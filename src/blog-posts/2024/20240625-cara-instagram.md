AKA: "Why Big Artists ARE LYING to You About Cara", _or,_ "Why Big Artists (Diss Cara, and) Want You to Stay on Instagram, Meta AI or Otherwise."

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YN8kkzjaalw

## Intro

Have you noticed how every popular ArtTuber on here has the same opinion-video on Cara and Instagram? That Cara'll never work out as an art app, and that Instagram is the best app for artists, despite the intentional nerfs to organic growth? Every time I go to peep the IG follower counts of these YouTubers, it's always 10s of thousands, 100s of thousands of followers. **There's a reason for that!!**

They want us to stay on Instagram, cause Instagram is holding them hostage by the follower-count. And they need their paying followers (to buy their commissions, art merch, etc.) to survive in capitalism. If their leading app _**were**_ to become unpopular, they'd have to start all over again. Fair. Real struggle.

But it's not the same for smaller accounts. Nowhere close.

## Main

Hi, it's Hika.

With Instagram's Meta AI TOS deadline right around the corner, I wanted to quickly get this video in amongst the wave of opinion videos from big art influencers suggesting Instagram is the art community's _**best and only**_ social media option going forward, despite Meta claiming all our text and image posts are forfeit to their text and image generation models.

Becauseâ€¦ _**hello?!**_ Of course it isn't. Have any of y'all TRIED being a small account in 2024? There is like, NO growth. It's not the same for smaller accounts.

The _**big**_ accounts grew during one of 2 phases of Instagram:

- The chronological feed & chronological hashtag search phase.
- The dawn of Reels.

It's now the summer of 2024. No one can search and find my 400-follower-count posts on Instagram in 2024, and Instagram isn't pushing reels from nobody-creators like me, anymore.

So why should I offer my digital art PNGs to Meta AI again? Tell me, genuinely. But not "why should _**you,**_ a _**big**_ artist, continue to offer your art to Meta AI". We know why already. It's where your paying customer base is, and we live in a capitalist society.

Why should _**I**_, 400-follower Joe, continue to keep feeding Meta's machine, when their app is (now) designed to prevent me from growing organically?

"But Cara is for artists only! My customers won't follow me there!"

You're entirely right. Heck, Cara wasn't even meant to be an Instagram or Twitter-category app in the first place. It was meant to be an ArtStation or DeviantArt alternative. It's just that the most visible voices after the Meta AI announcement, pointed towards Cara, which caused people to misinterpret what it exists for.

Cara, is for networking with other artists, and being reached out to by art & entertainment hiring managers, like ArtStation was, and that's ok.

IG is for sharing images with the world, artists or otherwise. Its more direct comparisons would be PixelFed, or the more multimedia Twitter, BlueSky, Tumblr, etc. It's why I'm lowkey disappointed whoever led the charge led it towards Cara instead of something else, but I digress.

Big artists, you don't have to quit IG. You _**shouldn't**_ quit IG, if the AI stuff doesn't bother you! 100k people that listen to you on one app is no joke! But if this Meta AI scare inspires you to do anything, let it inspire you to _**SLOWLY**_ diversify your eggs across many baskets. Don't let one app stay your master.

Start a mailing list, and give your most loyal followers incentives to subscribe. If they were helping pay your rent, they'd probably be the type to enjoy email updates from you anyway.

Crosspost. Heck, you don't even have to do it manually these days. Apps like Buffer, Fedica, Later, and PostyBirb will do it all for you. Links in the description. If you want tutorials for any of these, let me know in the comments. Legit all you have to do is type your title, caption, and hashtags once, then BOOM. Sent to multiple platforms, including Instagram! Done.

And anywhere you go, Nightshade and Glaze your images. Put your logo or watermark first, then Nightshade, then Glaze in that order. 1st-party scraping like Instagram is doing is ghoulish, but protect yourself from any rando art scrapers that may be crawling around as well.

To any small artists listening, follow all the same advice. We're lucky in that we're not as basket-egg-heavy as the big guys. So if we diversify our followings now, we won't be in _**their**_ predicament later.

Before I get out of here, can I call some of y'all big art influencers out real quick? Dawg what is up with the weird, fake-ass rumors y'all feel the need to spread? Like that Cara is also feeding everyone's images into AI? They're not. Or that Glaze is a tool meant to trick artists into adding their art to AI datasets? _**It's not.**_ The weirdest one I've seen is that Glaze has "free" and "paid" versions, and if you don't use the "paid" version, they'll add your art to an AI dataset.

None of this crap is true. Glaze, Nightshade, and Cara are all completely free. The only AI adjacent things they do is check if they did a good enough job scrambling your image to confuse the _**REAL**_ AI. If you feel the need to use a large platform to lie to people, or spread and perpetuate information you don't know to be true in order to scare your smaller-artist followers into staying on the app that benefits _**you**_ and not _them,_ that's kinda wack, and a little bit manipulative, sorry.

## Outro

Whenever I browse Instagram or even Threads, the way artists talk on there, big, or small, has this smell of "I feel like the platform isn't respecting me, but I'm stuck, I can't leave!" Whether it be the Meta AI junk, or that Instagram doesn't show your whole follower-base your posts, whether it's 100 followers or 1 million.

To that, I just want to make the argument that, if we don't like it, we _**can**_ leave if we want to. Leaving might even be the only way that we'll ever be able to stop putting up with this crap. I just _**also**_ want to make the argument that leaving bad apps isn't a 1-click process. It can take months, or even years to encourage your existing followers to spread out, or gain new followers on App B to balance the numbers you have on App A, etc.

And that's _**okay?!**_ And that's _**normal?!**_ We're too quick to give up. Most transitions aren't instantaneous, alright? Transitioning our online social media strategies should be a process. Take your time. Crosspost, glaze, and build that email list, or whatever.

At the very least, don't speak as if the strategy that benefits you, benefits everyone. Look below you. Bye.
