Holy YouTube Trending-Video Jumpscare, Batman!! It's time for another Weekly Roundup Thing! Potentially the last one before I switch to a new format. Monthly Art, Media, and Progress Roundups, and then Thoughts or Memory Blogging literally whenever I want.

If you've made it here from YouTube, hi! No need to backread or anything. You'll get used to this as you follow along, and stuff.

Here we go!!

## Art Roundup

No new art posts this week, but I have been cooking! Part of why I want to make roundups monthly. I like letting myself cook.

## Media Roundup

Soâ€¦ I made a [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HikaTamika) video. ðŸ˜¶ðŸ’§ (And a [TikTok](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika/video/7384574351422524702)/[Shorts](https://www.youtube.com/shorts/lmwmLQzSjwo)/[Reel](https://www.instagram.com/reel/C8p-JkFShtq/) clip promoting it with a clip. Way better than coming up with short videos from scratch or following beaten-horse trends btw.)

And it kind of, yeahâ€¦

I am very glad and extremely grateful that I could talk about something that I wanted to get off my chest over sped-up B-roll art footage without having to edit too much and people liked it. Which is good, cause I always wanna be putting most of my effort into my art work, but there are other things I enjoy doing to lesser extents of effort as well. Like video!

For the longest time I've kept my yapping text-based (like here,) and it is a format I like a smidge more (I was the kid with a diary that grew into a teen with a Twitter account), but, I guess all this time I should have been using my voice to yap instead of my fingers, I dunno!

## Social Roundup

On BlueSky, I made two Starter Packs. Starter Packs on BSky are a list of up to 50 users and 3 feeds that you can recommend to existing BSky users, but more specifically returning ones, and new ones on signup. In the era of For You pages and Explore feeds, people aren't used to finding accounts to follow by theirselves. I like Starter Packs as a human approach for helping people with that instead of leaving it to the almighty robot gods. I made one for [Original Character Creatives](https://go.bsky.app/BMpC1Ba), and one for [Cartoonists and Webcomic Artists](https://go.bsky.app/5sroLSs).

If you're reading this and you don't have a BlueSky or haven't used yours since you didn't know who to follow, consider using one or both of these Starter Packs! You won't regret it! It's lively in there.

## Art Progress

Making headway on the ref sheet I'm putting in the Clay Zine (a solo-zine about my android boy OC, Clay). I want the sheet to be good and thorough so that it can be a long time before I have to make one for him again, lol. I ended up modeling his 90s-00s Anime Robot Earsâ„¢ in Blender. I gotta make sure the hinge is rigged properly and texture/material the outside and add connection ports to the inside and (blah blah blah blahâ€¦)

I'm probably gonna be locking in on that and all the other stuff I have to do instead of ArtFight unless a productivity miracle happens, but we'll see!

## Art Thoughts

Bro lemme be real: a YouTube video blowing up, and the societal expectation of momentum after that, make me nervous cause I just wanna take as long as I need to cook. In art, in videos, in any form of self-expression, I'm better when I just give in to time and let myself actually do my best instead of being a content machine. But the algorithm likes content machines (except IG, IG's algo didn't even like me when I was doing that). I'm also afraid of running out of things to make yap videos about. Especially controversy-based videos with an edge (even tho I made my video itself way softer than the title and thumb lead one to believe).

Like after one more video on art and social media that I actually want to talk about, and then the crossposting tutorial I can do, I mainly want to talk about art stuff that makes me happy, as they come up in my mind. And I worry such videos'll be too cuddly, or potentially too infrequent for people to care. But after burning myself out on short video content (IG showed me no favors for posting reels and images frequently), I promised myself I'd only make content when I wanted to, as the ideas come, and only lock in to my OCs and writing their webcomic outlines.

I'm also nervous that the people that liked my video and subscribed right after maybe won't like me. Or like don't get me or what I'm into, what I'm about, etc. But, I think that's natural. I'm trying to see it like, that at the very least, the people that subscribed to me after one video are just curious on whether or not they'll like my next one, and maybe they will, or maybe they won't. Either-or is cool.

Something interesting, people read the description and checked out my links page! It seems they mostly chose to follow me on [Cara](https://cara.app/hikatamika) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/hikatamika/) though. (Go figure!) My absolute favorite social media app right now is [BlueSky](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com) because I'm in a [lovely community of OC artists](https://go.bsky.app/BMpC1Ba) (who'd love to have you around), but also because I feel like my thoughts are enough. Just saying hi is enough. With Cara and IG, (though Cara allows text posts,) I feel like I always have to be bringing an image, or a video to the table. I can't just show up and start yapping short little thoughts. But, I don't want to make content-art just to give myself something to yap underneath on there, so I hope everyone following me on those will be fine with me just showing up when I have something to share instead of _**absolutely**_ daily and weekly like the Social Media Gods recommend.

I crosspost as a habit, so that's not the problem, justâ€¦ on art-centric platforms compared to art-&-text ones (_yap_ text specifically, I feel like people don't yap much on Cara they just talk about what art things they're up to, or how the art industry is doing) get used to me locking in to Clip Studio Paint to make art that actually impresses me and expresses my imagination instead of like, "Quick Images of Blorbos that I can dish out daily/weekly". Y'know? Look forward to quality, but maybe not as much quantity.

(Slow-posting might not even be an actual problem. I think I might just be psyching myself out that all because I made a piece of content that exploded, means I have to post more and more frequently. Not rly, I guess.)

And with this Meta AI stuff in full effect now, they're on full-on like "If you post here past Jun 26th you are consenting to us yoinking your art for AI!! You're allowing us to do it!!"-level stuff. So, even with people keeping an eye on me there, l not sure I want to post full, flat, PNGs of my work it. 'tis just how I feel. I might find other ways to update my IG. Maybe just photos of my big ol' hand w/ my stylus on the screen, and a cropped thumbnail thing and tell people the full images are everywhere else that I post. And reels when I actually want to and think of something interesting I want to say.

## AstraPunk Postbox

So! Going forward, I wanna make my Art Roundups, Media Roundups, Art Progress, all the stuff like that into a monthly newsletter called the AstraPunk Postbox. I think it'd ease my task list up a bit, as well as be more appealing than asking y'all to visit a personal website every week.

The kinds of posts that make up my Art Thoughts segments though, or things like my Fanime 2024 recap blog, will be posted here whenever I feel like it (so maybe subscribe by RSS so you don't miss out[?]). I don't have anywhere for y'all to sub to the PostBox yet, but trust, I'll be a-hootin'-and-a-hollerin' about it once I do. I'd like one way to keep everyone up to date with the stuff I do in the current social media diaspora we find ourselves in.

Alright! That's all for this week. See you all on my next blog post, or at the AstraPunk Postbox.
