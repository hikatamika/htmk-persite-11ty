Real Title: New Online Platforms Aren’t “Dead”, You Just Don’t Have the Bandwidth to Engage with the Communities There.

**[Thumbnail by Lumen!](http://lurizon.neocities.org/)**

## Intro

Perhaps, once upon a time you were a "small artist", now you're big. A new platform arises and you hope your whole follower-count will join you on the new website, but a large chunk of those people haven't logged in in months, another large chunk of them ain't getting out of their chair, and the remaining users that _do_ follow you on New Website Dot Com are a mere decimal percentage of your old following. So when you get no engagement, you say it's the new platform's fault, and leave.

If only you could recall how you grew a following on your old site in the first place.

## Main

### Why Big Artists Don't Engage

It's not the new platform's fault, it's yours for not engaging. BUT!! BUT!! you have valid reasons to act the way you do and not engage. This is the You're Valid section of the video.

The main one is this: if you're big, your social media accounts typically serve as broadcasting channels to keep your fanbases up to date with _your_ work and _your_ work only. And though I'd suggest you just make a newsletter or update blog at that point, using your account for only your work is actually a fair content strategy for you, because Internet users are kinda lazy and cozy on apps these days, typically not blogs or newsletters.

Another reason why big accounts don't engage in ways that could help them on new platforms is this: it's simply a matter of low spoons. Garnering a big artist account often comes with a whole new set of responsibilities, stressors, and energy spent. Commissions in your queue, you've got an online store to manage, maybe you're traveling to artist alleys or art markets, paperwork and self-employed income taxes… it's a lot! And to be expected to log on and engage with people on New Website #43.com… after handling all that! Yeah, I get why people'd feel too stretched out to do so. Especially when you can post-n-ghost on a site you're already massive on and have their community there do all the retweet work for you, at no extra cost to your spoons.

So here's how to grow your account if engaging with others isn't an option you can afford.

### How to Grow Without Engaging

#### Make Valuable Content

Tutorials: Make content that others'd want to boost and share even if they have no community or comradery with you. The best examples are tutorials, recommendations, and other resources. If you post knowledge, other people will want to share it.

Fanart: Drawing people's favorite pop culture blorbos is another option. That way they only need to engage for the character they like, and not for you specifically. Yet.

Hot Takes: If you say things people agree with, they'll boost it so they don't have to say it theirselves. 'nuff said.

Engaging Content: Make content that people can't just scroll past without leaving their 2 cents. Sticking easter eggs into your art… drawing a detail wrong on purpose to get people to correct you in the comments… making a statement or asking people a question that values their response/opinion… (That last one's really good if you're talking about a fandom blorbo or something).

Though it's harder than just being friendly, there are quite a few ways of making content that inspires people to engage with your work without having to form acquaintanceships with them beforehand. Just use your noggin and intentionally try to reach this goal with your posts, because you'll need to in order to grow without commenting or boosting others.

TL;DR, **ASK:** what would make people engage with this post without needing a relationship with me. Tutorials, fanart, hot takes, and comment prompting or baiting are a start.

#### Hashtag Your Posts

If you're big on Twitter, you're probably aware that more than 2 hashtags can kill your post. This was made obvious when Elon dumped the algorithm code to GitHub. If you're big on Insta, you're probably used to hashtags not mattering all to much, being carried by your engaging followerbase and the SEO of your caption. So, you're probably used to tagging not making that big a difference, but you'd be surprised how helpful hashtags can be when you're starting out again. Especially on platforms with proper chronological timelines, topical feeds and proper search, like Bluesky, Cara, Mastodon, and SheezyArt.

(Not all of them have every feature mentioned.)

Unlearn hashtags being ugly. You're starting over, a bit from scratch, on platforms that _**won't**_ nerf you for them this time, remember? Toss a couple in. Especially if they're post-relevant, but you couldn't manage to stick them in the caption as natural words.

#### Ask Your Existing Gollowers to Cross-Follow

Ask your existing followers to cross-follow. Regularly. They've already formed a relationship with you and your work on one platform, so they can advocate for you with re-shares and positive comments elsewhere too.

I feel like a lot of people do this one once and then get upset when nothing happens immediately. Just gently and regularly remind people that you exist in multiple places, and the people that really friggin' like you will make sure they're following you on more than one place. The people that don't, may mainly be following you on a specific app because of convenience alone, unfortunately.

#### Participate in Art Shares

If you're a big account that doesn't Re-Share others posts because you need your timeline to be 99.9% your posts, participate in art shares that _**other people**_ host. Your lost followers on your other platforms'll prolly rediscover you this way. Or, new followers will just be amazed by your skill and follow. Cool!

The more reach the host has, the more effective, I guess??

Just, if you have the energy to spare a nice comment on someone else's work, and you don't mind that showing in your replies tab, please do it!

I hope these were interesting tips on how to have an interesting account in a new place while keeping interactions to a minimum. But, remember, that once upon a time you were small, and back then, you did something different that allowed you to gain the friendship and support of the artists and non-artists around you. Now, you find yourself small again on a new platform. What would past you do?

_**Engage with others. Duh.**_

### How to Grow by Engaging!

How to grow your account if you're a small account, _**AND**_ have the time and energy, or you're just based. (If not, don't sweat it.)

#### Step 1: Gallery/Update Site

Make a gallery, and newsletter or blog somewhere _else_; detached from your social media presences. This is so people have a place to go for _**your updates only**_, and you can use your social media for what its best at: socializing. Networking isn't just being cool at big fancy industry events. It's interacting with artists and art enjoyers around you online too.

Carrd's a good place for a gallery, so are SheezyArt, Cara, Foriio, and NeoCities. I'm currently using MailerLite for newsletters, but other people use MailChimp, ButtonDown, and Substack. Tumblr's a great place for a blog! Or NeoCities, or maybe CoHost. I recommend Wordpress if you can self-host a blog.

#### Step 2: Uplift Your Peers

Simple-as. If you find something your followers might like, share it so others can see. Sharing, retweeting, whatever you wanna call it: is the easiest and most reliable way to get someone else's posts seen. Way more reliable than hoping that your silent like will boost them in an algorithm. And, if you do it enough for other people, they'll be more inclined to return the favor. _**That's other people RTing you.**_ It sounds really obvious when I say it outloud, but you'd be surprised. People are still reluctant to do Re-Share.

If you're reluctant towards sharing too much, leave genuinely nice comments on people's stuff. Make sure your profile pic, banner, and bio indicate that you're an artist, so the original poster will want to go and check out your profile, and you might just get a follow! Just remember that no one owes you anything, especially not for one comment. Just do it out of the niceness of your heart, or to not keep a compliment locked inside of your head. Let em hear it!

And don't underestimate the power of being a regularly appearing positive voice in people's comments. People'll remember you by your display name and profile picture, "oh, it's that nice guy that's always in my comments," or "always in my friends' comments," and they'll eventually check you out! And if they like what they see, you'll get a follow.

You don't have to like, comment, and share every other artist you find, but do it for every art piece you _like_ or at _least_ for your besties so you can merge your followers together.

Another thing about engaging with others, or _friendly-maxxing_ as I like to call it, I already mentioned you shouldn't be friendly _just for the reward,_ cause you might not get it every time. Do it because you genuinely feel it inside. _**BUT ALSO!**_

Friendly-maxxing is most effective when you do it with people that are close to you. Close to you in fandom, interests, art medium, love for OCs, quote-unquote skill level, account size… try to engage with accounts that have things in common with you.

You'd think it'd be the most effective to friendlymax with the largest accounts, but they're busy with art-as-a-business and paying their self-employment taxes, remember?

If you interact with the people around you, and combine your follower counts, no matter their size, you'll grow. Then as you quote-unquote _**move up**_ or whatever, keep growing with the people around you, and your account will grow and grow and double and double.

It makes more sense than you'd think!

If you have to be strategic/number-headed about it, grow where you're at and let things multiply. If you wanna be YOLO-headed like me, just engage with art and accounts that inspire you

And get hit with imposter syndrome when you accidentally discover your little guy self left a hum-de-dum compliment on someone with a billion-zillion followers, lol!

## When to Pull Back

As of me writing this segment of the video, it's been about a month since I scripted everything else. I don't consider myself a "big" artist online, but I don't consider myself an invisible one either. Especially now that posts I make breach containment and attract people that like to argue with me and breach my boundaries. So I didn't want to make you this video without giving you some thoughts on when to pull back on engagement.

On sites, whether heavily algorithmic, completely chronological, or anything inbetween, I think once you have a sizeable network, (that's, both the amount of people following you AND a good amount of people _**you**_ follow [both matter].) Your growth and the reach of what you post will snowball, slowly growing in size with each thing you do, and you won't have to lean into engaging as much anymore if you don't want to. (I'd still recommend it if you can, but there are some situations that might signal it's time to pull back a bit.)

### Trolls

A common side effect of online growth is what we colloquially call, posts "breaching containment", or leaving their target audience by way of ReTweets, ReSkeets, whatever you call 'em. Your posts inadvertently get put in front of people who either don't have the context to understand them, or just plain don't like you, what you make, or what you say, and then these people might then engage negatively with your posts.

I'd like to encourage you to make use of the moderation tools available when this happens. Mute or block people who don't treat you or your posts with respect, or who drain you of your energy and happiness. At your discretion, of course. Especially consider use of moderation tools on those who'd love to waste their energy trolling you online. There are plenty of digital fish in this digital ocean, so don't feel too bad for having to resort to this if need be.

### Impacting Your Creativity

When engaging with the people you meet online, and keeping your finger on the pulse, make sure you're not eating too much into your creative time. You need to actually log off a bit in order to make art that you can bring back to social media.

Also, ensure that you're not leaning too hard into making things that you think is guaranteed to boost you in the algorithm. As someone that has tried to _intentionally_ game the algorithm for at least a year and a half, my anecdotal evidence is that it doesn't work. And algorithmic favor isn't guaranteed while you're growing before you reach snowball-effect size.

Always be true to your inner voice, your muse, what excites you, what you're passionate about, whether that be OC, fanart, a personal project, whatever. And engage with other people doing things that align with what you like. That's the greatest way to build a network of creative allies. Just make sure you're logging out enough and _creating_ so you have stuff to share with others. And so you don't get creative burnout.

### Impacting the IRL

Always, make time for obligations like work, and school. Be sure to give those your best. And take care of yourself. Eat, sleep, shower, go to the bathroom, the usual. Make sure your physical health is alright. If you, using ScreenTime checking apps, find that you spend too long scrolling and engaging on social media and not enough time taking care of your mind and body, do pull back a bit!

Even before your account reaches the network size that you benefit from the snowball-growth effect, a little engagement goes a long way. It doesn't have to come at the cost of your responsibilities or physical health. It shouldn't.

## Outro

I hope I've provided enough tips to get you started on new platforms, whether your content strategy includes engaging with others, or doesn't. Just understand the difference things each strategy requires. If your account, brand, responsibilities, or mind and body require a post-&-ghost strategy, be intentional with squeezing engagement out of your posts by making them as engaging as possible. And if you have the energy to be chronically online, engage with the artists and creatives around you. I've made tons of new buddies on my fave new platform, Bluesky that way! New platforms aren't "dead" in the way that people that have but in the work on old-platforms like to claim that they are. It's just that the work they've put in on the old platforms doesn't automatically transfer over like one would hope to. The friends and allies you'll make along the way by engaging are a heart-and-soul-warming bonus to the account growth you'll experience. Do consider making a mailing list or website for just your updates though. Whichever strat you pick.

Sorry I've been gone for so long! I find it a bit easier to dish out art and text posts than videos, so if you'd like to keep up with that, do follow me on BlueSky, Mastodon, Cara, SheezyArt, or Artfol. I feel like a lot of you only follow me on YouTube and I'm… worried I'll let you down by not posting videos as frequently as I post art.

I've been a bit displeased with Meta AI training and TwitterX Grok training, so I don't feel as inspired to post to those, unfortunately. Signing up on most of the sites I mentioned is easy though!

Sorry for doing the housekeeping part of video with my stream VTuber instead of my sprites! It's actually a LITTLE bit tedious switching the sprites in the beginning, and I'd like to transition to using my 3D model so I can record the audio and emote and express all in one shot. I hope that makes sense. My model was made by the amazing VLightning btw, I'll link their commission information in the description.

See ya! Hopefully next time I won't be ranting like this. I have some like, happy-yapping and hype-yapping I wanna do.
