I need to blog about this in the sense that I need to process this properly or a part of me might go crazy.

[July 30th, 2023.](https://hikatamika.com/2023/07/30/bye-bye-birdie/) That's almost a year and 3 months ago, [I wanted to quit Twitter](https://hikatamika.com/2023/07/30/bye-bye-birdie/) because of Elon Musk's bigotry and bad platform decisions. Even at that point, [he had plans to feed all of our text posts, image posts, and video posts into his LLM/generative AI,](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/07/14/elon-musk-plans-tesla-twitter-collaborations-with-xai.html?s=09) but it was more unclear then.

I feel like, back then, people looked at me like I was crazy. Like "*sure* dude, do what you want". I guess a year and 3 months is what it took for people to realize making a once great site worse, feature by feature, was Elon Musk's personal hobby. He fell deeper into Alt-Right and Fascist mindsets. ChatGPT and copycat bots took over comment sections to the point that Japanese users called them ["Impression Zombies"](https://unseen-japan.com/impression-zombies-japan-social-media/). Let alone the porn bots, commission/freelance bots, and weird, despicable humans Elon Musk attracted by espousing heinous politics, who all paid for Blue Checkmarks so they could get to the top of our feeds.

I guess it just took my friends and people I looked up to a while to smell how serious the stench of Twitter's rot had gotten. And it's nowhere near easy to leave. Especially for people who used Twitter for commission/shop reach (until they found that they were increasingly getting less bites on the site that'd been helping them survive in this capitalist hell-scape world for so long). At the time, BlueSky was still lacking a lot of features like videos and DMs that people needed to promote theirselves and communicate with potential clients, etc., etc., etc..

I guess over at BlueSky we've been slowly building in the background, and people have increasingly come in at different points.

- [When we did away with invite codes.](https://techcrunch.com/2024/02/06/bluesky-is-now-open-for-anyone-to-join/)
- [When Elon got X banned in Brazil by not complying with its laws.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blocking_of_Twitter_in_Brazil)
- [And now with him watering down the block feature, and making it ***undoubtedly clear*** compared to July 2023, that yes, **our text, videos, and images are going into the grokAI dataset.**](https://www.techradar.com/computing/websites-apps/xs-controversial-changes-to-blocking-and-ai-training-sees-half-a-million-users-leave-for-rival-bluesky-which-then-crashes-under-the-strain)

And that's excluding the other little trickles we got for more minor annoying adjustments Elon made.

I'm not gonna hit people with the I-Told-You-So behavior, cause to me that's a very negative thing to do. I'm just glad folks are here now. Granted, it's mostly artists, art enjoyers (especially VTubers that don't draw theirselves), and people that feel endangered by unfunctional blocks. I think we'll really have legs to stand on when like, fandomers, gamers, content creators, Joe by the water cooler, and Aunt Susan, start to reach for BlueSky instead of X, or even Instagram, but we've a ways to go before that, I think.

Anyway y'all came in great numbers and ***it's freaking me out*** (not bad, just overwhelming!!). I've had my 2nd Twitter account since 2013, and must have had my first since like 2010 or 2011. I never broke 350 followers on there. That's like, over a decade of Tweeting. (Granted, I started quite young, lol!) Lowkey, I'd figured I'd just be relatively undiscovered online outside of friends and micro-communities all my life.

You can imagine I was nerve-wracked when Elon's block/AI-blunder took me from 1.6k followers (already out of this world for me,) to 3.8k. Not even a humble-brag. I'm frankly terrified. I don't know what to do. I'd built my connections on BlueSky by talking to nearly ***everyone*** I crossed paths with, and pouring hours giving back to my followers (by means of comments and reskeets), [by watching the custom "Followers" Feed. (It shows you posts from people you don't follow back.)](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-followers) There are now three-thousand eight-hundred and sixty-six great people following me. I can scroll that feed in image only mode for thirty minutes to an hour and barely even make a dent in getting to the bottom. I can't manage to do that as thoroughly as I used to, but there's a voice in my head that says I deserve absolutely nothing of what I've managed to achieve unless I keep serving the community I've built to the fullest extent possible, ***OR ELSE!!!*** And, IDK what to do.

When I was in 300-follower-Andy mode on every other platform. Xitter, Instagram, TikTok, whatever else, and even smaller on the indie ones like Mastodon, CoHost, Inkblot, and Artfol, I'd always tell myself, "we gotta grow… we gotta grow, so I can show my OCs to people". Now thanks to Elon's slip-up, I've grown, but I'm running into a dilemma where, I need to figure out how I as one person can continue to serve a community I've built instead of just showing them stuff and expecting them to continue appreciating me. Y'know what I mean? Like that ain't right. My experiences online make me feel like that wouldn't be right.

When I was a "smol artist" and whatnot, like, I thought "Big Artist™s" were distant and stuff like that, but seeing them come to BSky and talk about their experience, they kinda had no choice.

1. They weren't super social and interactive with their social media profiles they because felt like their followers wouldn't follow them to websites/newsletters where they could broadcast solely about theirselves.
2. They felt *algorithmically punished* for being interactive and chatty after a certain point.
3. A lot of people is *a lot of people* to serve and interact with!
   When I look at my PC time tracker's report on my daily-total BlueSky hours, ***I*** get kinda shocked! They gotta go run off (log off) and create! At least for stretches of time.

I don't know what to dooooo…

I feel like people following me wouldn't mind me putting my head down and getting to work on my projects (instead of scrolling my Non-Moot-Followers Feed endlessly for underrated posts to RT) but it'd make me feel like I'm betraying everyone.

It's not like I wanna stop RTing stuff, I love RTing stuff, but, I can't do the thing where I try to scroll to the bottom of my [24-hour-maximum Followers Feed anymore](https://bsky.app/profile/jaz.bsky.social/feed/my-followers). Doing so mattered to me because I'd been in the Online Shadow Realm for over a decade. But time spent scrolling it, is time I'm not working on freelance and personal projects. IDK what to do. But there are things I consider core principles of my SocMed behavior that I don't want to give up on, like

- Replying to people when they're genuinely being nice and having conversation.
  (And I can think of something substantial to say in reply.)
- Commenting on cool stuff in general so people feel seen and appreciated.
- Reskeeting stuff on my profile. (If people ***really*** wanted to see just-***my***-art, they'd use the many in-app and off-site methods of doing so that I've made available to them).
- Keeping people I find that make cool stuff in [Lists](https://bsky.app/lists) for easy browsing in [Feeds](https://bsky.app/feeds). (Help help help I've hit the Follow button too liberally, my main TL is a mess help wargh--)
- Not carrying myself 100% like a business on a ***SOCIAL*** Media app. (My Ko-Fi will be where I can be interacted with like a business. The Portfolio site I'm working on is where I can be seen and perceived as a professional. [Though my Social Medias will always be work-appropriate, they will not be wholly Formal™ by any means.])

I just don't know if those five things are enough to be a person worthy of people's support and attention. Especially as I prepare to launch my goofy little webstore and more Ko-Fi rewards in 2025, like… like "if Hika can't even help *me* escape the Online Shadow Realm, why should I help them live/create?"

That kind of thing.

Waaargh!!

*\*runs away...\**
