Heyo everyone! I'm trying to get back into longform yapping a bit more again. Especially as [CoHost](https://cohost.org/) is sunsetting by the end of the year, [Tumblr](https://www.tumblr.com/hikatamika) is not the place for… Original Character content, and this site currently runs on WordPress, so why not.

My guest episode on the Sparkleside Chats ([Apple](https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/sparkleside-chats-with-magical-girl-ayu/id1529215797), [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/show/5ertY7ARBocUKdRQ0ricHg)) podcast is finally out! :D I had so much fun talking about Onegai My Melody with [Magical Girl Ayu](https://bsky.app/profile/magicalgirlayu.bsky.social)!! The Magical Girl Warrior is my favorite trope/premise, and I've had a long-standing love for Sanrio since childhood, then gained more Brand Awareness for Sanrio in around middle school, which is when I started watching Onegai My Melo!! (Subbed on YouTube in three parts… of the times…)

I know I yap occasionally on YouTube (I'll do more of that in 2025!), but this is my first podcast appearance! It means a lot to me to be able to belong in the Magical Girl community despite being one of those "I'm working on my webcomic, I swear!!"-guys.

By way of anime subtitle, they ask the viewer to tune in to the latest episode of Sparkleside chats." %}

Anywho, please give the episode a listen, if that sounds interesting. And [I'll see you around](https://hikatamika.com/links/)!
