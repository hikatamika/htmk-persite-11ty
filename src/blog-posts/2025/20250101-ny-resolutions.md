Aight, I wanted to immortalize my New Year's Resolutions onto this blog… …and give them a loose order of importance? I won't be yapping about each one extensively though. Saving that for my [Monthly SupportCast thing](https://ko-fi.com/post/My-Artist-Plans-for-2025-SupportCast-Dec-2024-Q5Q1178SF3) I do over on my [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika). The one for January (talking about December) will go out around January 7th.

Without further ado!

## Must Do

1. Have a structured week instead of a free-flowing one. (Especially re: leaving my day-job.)
   - Shifts & Breaks, Time-Logging, Content Calendar
2. Spend less unintentional time scrolling socials. (BSky, YouTube)
3. Stronger time boundaries against other people.
4. [UnF*ck My Habitat](https://www.unfuckyourhabitat.com/).
5. Do small-business paperwork.
6. Make steady creative income online. ([Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika), [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/@HikaTamika), [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/HikaTamika), [Shop](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/shop))
7. Focus on Project Art (even spoiler stuff I can't share).
   - Finish chapter-based LXNX outline.
8. Make, print, and sell one-shot comics.
9. Go to zine-fests & comic-fests!

## Extra

1. Use the manga lettering Udemy course I got.
2. Build a Nurturing Community. (Discord…? Website…?)
   - Discussions with people who like my stuff… but not tied to a greater, public, Social Media platform. Too much noise.
   - But moderating communities is hard.
