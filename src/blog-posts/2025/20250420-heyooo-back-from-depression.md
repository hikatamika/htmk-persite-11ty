Realizing I should post on here more, however I want, and however I need, so, after updating the [gallery](https://hikatamika.com/art-gallery/) a bit, I wanted to say [I was depressed for a bit, but I'm Okay Now](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7s63eaYngVw). /loose-reference-I-guess

I got hit with it like, twice, once after the other, and it worsened my wellbeing, I guess that's the truly important part that I should mention first, but the part I instinctually want to mention first is that it impacted my art output and ultimately caused me to miss April's [Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika) SupportCast and Process Videos. I get the feeling that my supporters aren't put off by *one* missing month, but it still makes me sad anyway.

I'll get into it forreal on May's SupportCast, but the gist of it, was that first, …tactless? …contextless? empty…? BlueSky interactions and "Big Account™" stress made me feel misunderstood and isolated. Then I got a wave of depression from that.

Next!! Uh!! I found out I was [Aro-Ace](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Aroace) and had been masking as [Alloromantic-Allosexual](https://lgbtqia.wiki/wiki/Aromantic_Allosexual) ever since late-middle-school, which was a lot to process, and a lot to grieve. (Not everyone has to grieve orientation-realizations, but I did!) I got a wave of depression from that too.

But by the power of being unable to fail at pre-established promises, I went to the SF Cherry Blossom Festival with [Kris/Cinnamuff](https://cinnamuff.space/), and the oxygen and vitamin D flipped some kind of switch in my brain, and after like a day or two of rest, I started to feel a lot better; able to get back to work.

And that's where we are now. Uhh… cool things are happening one at a time, I guess.
The one thing that will be happening for sure ***OR ELSE\*** is that I'll be soft-launching my rinky-dink [physical goods store on Ko-Fi](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika) this Thursday or Friday. So look out for that if you're interested in stickers/zines/prints.

And uh, yeah. That's all for now. Wanted to keep this one brief.
Bye! ✌️
