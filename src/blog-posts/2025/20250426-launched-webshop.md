Where do I even begin with this… Well, *[it's on my Ko-Fi page,](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/shop)* but where do I start with the talking-about-it part…

<div class="photoswipeable">
  <a href="" class="photoswipee " data-pswp-width="" data-pswp-height="">
  <img src="" alt="" class="">
  </a>
</div>

<!-- Slider main container -->
<div class="swiper">
  <!-- Additional required wrapper -->
  <div class="swiper-wrapper">
    <!-- Slides -->
      <div class="swiper-slide photoswipeable">
        <a class="photoswipee" href="" data-pswp-width="" data-pswp-height="" target="_blank"><img class="gallery-img" src="" alt=""></a>
      </div>
  </div>
  <!-- If we need pagination -->
  <div class="swiper-pagination"></div>
  <!-- If we need navigation buttons -->
  <div class="swiper-button-prev"></div>
  <div class="swiper-button-next"></div>
</div>

I think the best place to start is acknowledging I had plans to launch some kind of online store [as early as 2023](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika/video/7263228364310220078). [*Attempts even continued into 2024*](https://www.tiktok.com/@hikatamika/video/7356242766206160171)! I think I got distracted and interrupted by a lot of things. Depression, getting jobs, leaving jobs, driving lessons… IDK. ***Perfectionism…***

A big part of why I stalled was intimidation and feeling like I had to be ***exactly*** like the people I was seeing (the YouTube Artist Alley girlies that can afford homes) _exactly **at**_ the moment I saw them (well into their success, considering the algorithm brought them to me).

And tbh,

***nah…***

If you look at my store right now it's very obviously "1.0"-looking, and I'm ok with that. *I'm* very "1.0"-looking, my ***whole-life*** is very "1.0"-looking. Gonna be ok with that. Gonna iterate.

I'm proud of this 1.0 step! And… I'm proud that people seem to really like my original items?! I had made fanart items out of anxiety and assumed obligation, but they're not moving an inch, haha. All in all though, I'm glad I finished the launch because… this might be the only way I "sell" my illustration as a skill. At least for a while. Art commissions are hard for me to self-motivate on, unlike how I can get in the zone with graphic design, 3D, web design, etc. commissions.

If you'd like to keep up with any major projects like the shop, but also zines and comics, long YouTube videos that I actually consider Good for the Culture™, etc, head on over to the [Mailing List page]()! I revamped both it, and the mailing list. 

That's all for now!
