## Intro
Hi. I had the worst realization.

***I don't like timelines anymore.***

Well, though that's the raw way that it feels, that's also me exaggerating a bit, I think.
To be more objective about it: timelines are not the primary way I enjoy engaging with the Internetâ€¦ anymore? They probably used to be, both when I was a nobody (on other social media, and Bsky too), and, when BSky was small. But now that neither I, nor the site I use, are in an obscure, tiny corner, something changed.

I saw it come for friends, moots, and people I follow first. A sort of Bluesky-fatigue. And though there are common threads, I find the fatigue is a little different for everyone I've seen express it. For me there are a couple factors.

## Political Climate
For starters, the political climate of where I live, the United States, is in the absolute pits right now. And when our situation is in the pits, it seems to find a way of spreading the stink to the rest of the world, especially the online world. Add onto that an economic recession and a new, horrible headline each day, and a lot of powerless people only feel the power to make an impact when they spread awareness to highly critical happenings. I think this, at its core, is good, the intentions are good. But, I think we're all terrible newscasters. Throw away propaganda state-controlled news outlets for a second, right, there's a reason (good) journalists *are* journalists, and normies are normies. But, to curb despair in a world with such a powerless setup, a lot of us (ðŸ™‹) have become micro-journalists and we all bombard each other with (often unpolished) reporting of news, and ideas for courses of action.

Because we all do it one by one, we create timelines for ourselves and each other where half the posts on them are different, subtly contradicting retellings of current events. Due to how rapidly we do it, not all of those retellings are tidied or accurate like a polished, re-read, edited news-piece would be. "React-First, Post-Later" has been in our microblogging blood since Twitter popularized the format.

Similarly, we all, without consulting with each other to make organized action plans, each come up with our own master-threads on how to take sociopolitical action on things. This muddies the result and makes us weaker than our opposition.

To reference recent game and book censorship on Itch.io, Collective Shout, the censorship group, has a website, and planned and executed an organized attack. We Blueskyers had multiple master-threads, some telling us to go for credit cards and payment processors, some telling us to hit *e-commerce* platforms where it hurt. We were running around like chickens with our heads cut off when the news broke. Experiencing the Bluesky response to the Itch.io censorship in real-time lowkey made me want to join both political and worker orgs, cause it made me want to experience how structure, organization, and planning can make me feel like I have a leg up in this world, compared to the Social Media "everyone has a soap-box and a megaphone" Experienceâ„¢. (Not to dunk on people that use their social media in this way. Again, I think it's coming from the right place in a very wrong world. The results just feelâ€¦ less effective in the aftermath despite having immediate hope-effects for the person posting. Trust me! I have been one of those posting people!)

Before the next thought, let me make one thing clear. [The genocide of Palestinians in Gaza being carried out by the IDF is capital-W Wrongâ„¢.](https://damifalasteeni.neocities.org/) It's atrocious, and it's not right. Literal "Boo! You stink!" to both of my countries, the UK and the US, for funding it and supporting it and allowing it to happenâ€”especially with my tax dollars. Real blood-on-hands type stuff.

It really gets to my gut seeing people ping me for aid and me not being in a secure financial state to help. My near-empty bank accounts feel like a foot-soldier, and the IDF, UK, and US feel like titans. I think I've also (incorrectly) allowed myself to feel intimidated by people adding me to "Spammer", "Scammer", and "Antisemite" lists for thinking "hey, genocide is objectively bad" and RTing a lot of Palestinian aid posts a while back. (In the sense that, these people adding me to these lists probably would never have wanted to be my friends anyway. Or, we'd disagree on something else if not Palestine.) I already feel like an annoying BSky user for how much stuff I RT in general. I want to get more/new work so I can have the spare funds to donate again, but it's about coming to the point where I'm reaching into pockets, and after all the bills I have to pay, I'm pulling up pocket lint. I need to get ready to send out job apps ASAP.

If you'd like to help me donate, I still have the [Nox Indigo prints in my shop](https://ko-fi.com/s/77e150af55) where all the money from your purchase of the print goes to the Palestinian Red Crescent Societyâ€¦!
No oneâ€¦ has picked one up since I listed them. I wonder if it's because people think it's a futile effort due to Israel working to block aid all the time (***BOO!***). Or if it's just a bad, cringe, print, hahaâ€¦ It came from a really passionate place though.

Anyway, closing out this subsection of the blog post, I want to iterate that it's the IDF's, the US', and the UK's fault for making me feel this way. It's not the *victims of Genocide's* (who have to deal with it ***IN REAL LIFE**'s*) fault for me feeling secondhand despair over a genocide. 100% it's the fault of the oppressor and those who ally with the oppressor. [Free Palestine,](https://damifalasteeni.neocities.org/) manâ€”nowhere near chickening out on that.

ANYWAY, NEXT!

## The Nature of  MicroPosts & Timelines
If you've been following [my BSky snaps](https://bsky.app/hashtag/HKsnaps?author=hikatamika.com), or [my Ko-Fi vlogs](https://ko-fi.com/post/Project-Tours-Galore-SupportCast-July-2025-V7V81HQZVM), you may have noticed I've been really into art books, lately. A lot of them tutorial books, but a good deal of them little galleries of a section of an artist's (or a project's) body of work. I like visiting and revisiting them, and I feel like it's representative of something greater:

***I prefer interacting with other people's art on a per-artist basis.***

Whether it's Bluesky, or Xâ„¢, or Tiktok, or Instagram, or even Tumblr: art, media and thoughts are presented to me in a firehose fashionâ€”be it by reverse-chronological order, or an algorithmic sort. Even if it's my own, personal, chose, curated, *smaller firehoses* than the one platform-wide firehose. I see one art piece or expression at a time, from artist-A, then B, then C, then D, then Eâ€¦ one after the other. This viewing experience does a few things.

- It makes me feel like everyone is successfully producing constant media outputâ€”except me. Regardless of whether or not that is true! The way both kinds of timeline sort work, shuffling the order in which artists appearâ€”many people *might* be producing Contentâ„¢ as slowly as I (caught up in freelance and job-hunt prep still) am, but the TL will make it look like "everyone is producing except me"!
- It's a bit of a cliche at this point, but, The Engagement Numbersâ„¢ lead me to feel like everyone else is performing better than me compared to *when I finally **am*** able to offer up a new art piece or shop item.

The algo-shuffle way of viewing artists' work and people's thoughts also ***fails*** to do a few things. I'll represent them in reverse by expressing what art books *do **successfully*** for me.

- When I read an art book, I'm able to see a piece of work in the context of that artist or project's larger body of work; providing context. I'm able to make connections in style, theme, influence, message, and more. In algo-shuffle order, after looking at one person's single piece of work, I am immediately shown someone else'sâ€”severing any per-artist connections my mind can form.
- A side-effect of the context thing is, when I see work on a per-artist basis, I'm more easily allowed to learn, analyze, and make myself a better artist, or writer, or thinker. When I consume someone else's thoughts on a per-person basis, I'm more easily able to make myself a better, or at least more well-rounded person by understanding points of view that aren't mine.
- Even if I were to visit an individual's profile on a microblogging platform, the way character limit forces us to thread or outright truncate thoughtsâ€¦ makes microblogging a very low-context or at least broken-context place.

## What Now?
"Well," you start. "We're online, not on paper. What do art books have to do with the internet?"

Blogs and personal websites are the equivalent. Blogs and personal websites I can get notifications from via RSS feed. (Think of RSS as a notification publishing language. You can learn more about it [here](https://bsky.app/profile/jpawlik.com/post/3kak36ysck627) and [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJpu9tuLb8k).)
Any place I can see one artist's, or one thinker's, or one project's collection of art and completely-portrayed thoughts in one place, without being interrupted or interjected by anyone else's: is the equivalent. That's part of why I'm coming back to my WordPress blog to say this even though I'm still working to move my site over to [11ty](https://11ty.dev).

Similarly, I've paused updating my WordPress gallery out of really wanting to move over to 11tyâ€¦ With the plugin I use for my WordPress gallery, adding a new art piece is kind of a multi-step-hullaballoo compared to how easy it's been to add pieces to my 11ty-built portfolio (my casual, personal-site art gallery will work similarly to my portfolio).

But, yeah. I can see myself putting more effort into my personal sites, and the experience I want to give to their visitors.

***That's me, though.***

Most English-speaking artists don't blog, or maintain personal sites any more.
Just a Squarespace portfolio they update once in a while for getting work. (/not-a-dig)

After the social media boom, there hasn't really been much incentive for people to make or maintain personal sites and blogs. People's natural needs for attention and connection feel better-met by social media platforms, whether or not that's actually the case. And, people feel more belief-in and awareness-of how to monetize their social media presences than any potential personal-site traffic.

I felt the same way about social media, till I reached what my 2010-2023!self dreamed of: Lots of Followers On-Lineâ„¢, only toâ€¦ not have that eliminate financial worry. (NOT that it's a follower's job to financially support someone they follow. [More social government policies, please!] Just that, somewhere along the line we've seen and internalized social media followings as ***The*** online door that opens financial stability. But, it's kinda not. At least not for everyone.)

So, the Internet version of the American Dreamâ„¢ is not really a reason for me to hustle and posture on social media anymore. ðŸ¤·

***Connection still is though.*** ðŸ«µ

Social media's main pull for me is how it's managed to put all my friends from different spaces and friend circles *in one place*. As a person who feels like they "belong" to many different individuals and non-overlapping social circlesâ€¦ Social media has successfully managed to make me rely on it to feel connected. Since graduating college, I don't have much going on socially IRL. Myâ€¦ oddly-specific queerness and failure to pass as the [non-binary] gender I want to portray, further discourage me from reaching out to high-school classmates, or making local friends. I can be whoever I want online.

So, you know. Congrats to the social media industry, forâ€¦ successfully becoming an outright Needâ„¢ in my life. They better cuddle up to investors though, cause I don't have plans to give Bluesky, X, Meta, or TikTok a cent. ðŸ’€

So yeah. Blog as I might, link-page as I might, webring as I might, I know most people will keep to their timeline experiences. Blogs and personal sites are seen as outdated communication methods.

Again, there's no reason for me to outright abandon social media. Since [SkyFeed-based feeds](https://skyfeed.app/) can only pull from the past-seven-days of the sitewide firehose at most, I only need to log into Bsky to browse at least every 7 days. I want to see how it feels logging in every 3 days.

I already use [Publer](https://publer.com/), a scheduling service, to post the important things like art piece, shop, project, and Ko-Fi updates, so I can keep doing that as far as posting goes.

I'm pessimistically convinced most artists I like will *not* be making/maintaining blogs or even using no-limit, browsable "one-poster-at-a-time" sites like Pixiv, Cara, SheezyArt, or Tumblr (***with its blog-website feature on,** they've removed that being the default lately, in favor of its inferior timeline view*), soâ€¦ yeah.
I'll probably be using Bluesky's built in RSS feature (add /rss to any profile URL) for those absolutely can't miss accounts.

But yeah, I think admitting this to myself incoherently last night ([1](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3lvfgtjt2q22o), [2](https://bsky.app/profile/hikatamika.com/post/3lvfhhgftxk2y)), and coherently today has been kinda freeing. A weight off my shoulders. Shout out [Steve Burns from Blues Clues for letting me spill](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IDfoRMq8G9w).

Anyway, that's all for now!!! See y'all on Bsky still. (Albeit, HOPEFULLY to a lesser degree after transitioning how I use it.) And I'll be working on finishing my 2.0 site so I can express more on it, which'll help in relying on Bsky a little less.

***Make a blog/gallery/site with an RSS feed rn!!***

Ok byeeeeeee
