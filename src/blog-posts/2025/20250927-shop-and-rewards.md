**Immediate Disclaimer:** I'm not giving up on, or running away from, making and selling physical shop items or distributing exclusive membership content, but I am changing the way I go about both, for my current recovery and future health.

You've probably noticed I've experienced a sudden snap and subsequent decreased online presence starting late August that's ongoing. I think I've been allowing creative burnout to slowly grow inside me, undetected due to the validation-and-dopamine-hamster-wheel-feedback-loop that is the current state of social media. It's been a bit of a rat race, and I have, bluntly, been feeling like a failure for growing a following of ~7,500, yet only gaining the general "pressed-the-like-button" attention of 1.3% of that audience and only motivating 0.10% of that audience to financially aid my endeavors through tiered membership or shop purchases.

It's a two-punch struggle of both the current sociopolitical and economic state of the world, and, the fact that social media sites have been fine-tuned in such a way that users are only motivated to give mere seconds of their attention to each person they interact with as they browse. The companies that design these platforms and formats want your attention to go to the overall scrolling experience, not the hundreds and thousands of unique human beings that make up that experience. Even in the case of platforms like Bluesky and Mastodon. Both have good intentions with their replications of the microblogging format, but the way users interact with microblogging is shaped by the unhealthy intentions of peak/late-stage Twitter, which, again, wasn't designed for us to pay much attention to the individuals that make up feeds. (I think, anyway.)

**All that being said, I enjoy making and distributing my art as physical experiences,** so I'm inclined to keep an art shop going one way or another. And, **I enjoy keeping distribution of certain art, thoughts, and other media to paid supporters**, instead of the "Pearls before Timeline" effect that public-facing social media has on posts that we all put a lot of effort into. So, I'm inclined to keep paid memberships/exclusive posts going one way or another.

## The Future of Hika

**Step 1** is curing myself of art burnout, which I'm currently in the process of. The yearning to create art is still there. I just have to resist the fears that no one will care, and my art isn't worth being allowed to live. Regardless of whether those fears are true or not, art and storytelling are how I both feed and express my spirit, so I'm trying to dip my pinkie-toe back into the lake like a frightened swimmer.

**Step 2** is curing myself of social media/posting burnout. [Finishing my personal website](https://hikatamika.com/) has helped with this, as I now have a place where my [art](https://hikatamika.com/art-gallery/) and [thoughts](https://hikatamika.com/blog/) no longer become disposable trash if "too much time" has passed on a post with "not enough engagement" accumulated. An ever-present archive where nothing decays.

As I get my art flowing again, I'm also experimenting with not posting art pieces until either 14 days have passed since their completion, or in the case of sketchbook art, until the former is true ***and*** the sketchbook that the drawing belongs to is complete. A lot of the pain that finally announced the presence of my growing burnout, was influenced by me posting art that was too fresh. Art that still had my heart, soul, blood, guts, and ego attached to it… that would then perform poorly or not inspire much-if-any Ko-Fi support through related rewards. It'd make me and my art feel like garbage.

***So!*** I figured if I used more of a time-buffer between completing art and sharing it, my heart, soul, blood, guts and ego would return to my *body* where they belong, or, move onto another piece that I'm working on that the internet has yet to catch a whiff of. This could be good. 

## The Future of the Shop

Relatedly, there is a chance that I may no longer live in California and be forced to move in with family in another state by the year's end, so please take advantage of [the ongoing 50%-Off Clearance Sale](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/link/STRUGGLEBUS) so I wouldn't have to move my stock with me or dispose of it if that happens. Thanks.

Having a 24/7, 365-day online shop also makes me feel like I've failed. (The 7,500 followers, 20 sales: *to date* thing.) Seeing unsold stock gather dust on my shelves makes me feel like I've failed. I tell myself I've made great marketing pushes, and the art of the items is nice, so, again, I'm going to attribute it to the global recession, and social media's attention-redirection to the overall scroll instead of the individual. The negative effects an always-open shop has had on me are still present though. My art and survival both feel disapproved by the masses even though that isn't the truth of what's going on, or the truth of my followers' hearts as they browse Bluesky. Sometimes the effect is just the effect anyway. Brains are truly terrible organs.

*In order to continue experiencing the joy of turning my art into physical experiences that exist in the hearts and homes of others, **without causing me to feel like I'm continuously failing*** I think it'd be best to close my art shop in December, and reopen it sometime in the future, hopefully 2026, on a 3-4 shop openings a year basis.
I could slowly accumulate media (COMICS!!! ZINESSSSS…) and art for other kinds of products over time. Then, dedicate some time to developing and posting marketing, have a 2-3 week window open for sales, make-and-ship enough product at home to meet the ***actual*** demand people have without waste, and then relax and return to art projects and work that can properly sustain my existence.

That's what I think would be best. Instead of the social-media induced nature of pouring so much life into something that isn't working under the idea of "well, maybe if I pour more life into it, it'll suddenly work!" meanwhile, I am like… dying and stuff.

## The Future of Memberships

I ***like*** the idea of memberships because… ideally, they serve as an automatic filter. Though there are probably plenty of people who enjoy my art and presence as an individual instead of a scroll-ingredient… …who are being slammed by the recession and can't contribute, anyone who is a member is *highly likely to enjoy my art and presence as an individual*, if that makes sense. And it just feels good to give back to folks who want to help enable me to spend more time doing what I'd actually want to do with my life.

That being said, giving myself a rewards-deadline type thing… has its downsides. Especially if/when my spirit becomes "sick" like in my current burnout moment. Putting high-effort into my rewards (I put too much video editing, subtitle corrections, and thumbnail graphic design into each SupportCast episode, for example) when I'm bleeding out savings and facing being kicked out… is too much.

Ko-Fi has (recently?) given creators [a text box with which to define and declare the terms of our paid memberships](https://help.ko-fi.com/hc/en-us/articles/29017015021853-Setting-your-terms#h_01K0R7KRC1YWPR34JBQMZ3P4H1), and I'll be writing up new terms for it. I cannot guarantee a monthly SupportCast, auto-timelapse, speedpaint, and layered PSD anymore. I mean, look at me. Burnout has devoured September. I am in the process of seeking full-time employment to replace my current "freelance + content creation" setup because its unsustainability has become clear.

Even after my burnout is healed, this puts the SupportCast, even in a non-monthly sense, at the most immediate risk due to having to correct automatic subtitles of highly talkative videos. Basically, all rewards will be distributed on an "as I make them" basis, which is easy enough for things like HD Art, Timelapses, WIPs and Sketches, Process GIFs, Behind the Scenes Posts, and things like that. But those SupportCasts? They might become intermittent and be replaced by SupportBlogs as needed. Additionally, switching my shop over to a windowed system instead of a 24/7-365 system affects when the member discounts can be utilized, as well.

I think a full-time job can, funnily enough, replace the way I have made Ko-Fi, or the lack of it, validate my existence. I think I can balance it with art and comic creation as long as I don't doomscroll and doombinge on evenings and weekends. My social media detox has proven to me that it's easier than I thought. I also have fewer familial and interpersonal responsibilities than other adults, but I digress.

And yeah, I believe, that covers just about everything. Please adjust or cancel your memberships if any of this discourages you. [Please consider taking advantage of my 50% off clearance if something catches your eye.](https://ko-fi.com/hikatamika/link/STRUGGLEBUS)

Thanks for taking the time to read this. I know demanding *this* much attention as only *one* of your many internet guys is genuinely asking a lot of you in this busy world we live in.

See you later!
