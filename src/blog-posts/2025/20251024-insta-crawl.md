And TikTok. But I shouldn't give much of a damn about what happens on such platforms, for a few key reasons.

(Preface: If your gut instinct is to run to follow me on Insta: wait and read the whole blog post first, then think carefully before you decide. Cheers.)

## _**You?!** On Insta? **WHY?!**_
A lot has been going on this month. Bluesky waffle-gate, another social media detox (which I'm still in, as of writing: Oct. 24), and pedal-to-the-metal job hunting. All that snowballed into such an outlandish thought, if you're familiar with how I think: _that maybe I should post on Instagram again_.

A bit of context: similar to the current Bluesky (and social media as a whole) semi-burnout I'm in now, I've had Instagram and TikTok burnouts too. Putting in a ton of effort, said effort not returning in measurable ways, the addiction-optimizing and self-worth-destroying UI choices getting to me, the whole nine yards.

Similar to—but in a more professional way than—I put my human (alien?) foot forward on Bluesky, I've been encouraged by friends to post on LinkedIn more to put my human foot forward in front of hiring managers and recruiters in the industries I'm interested in. I don't really have to pour my soul into LinkedIn the same way I have on BlueSky, but there's a lot I've done creatively using my skills that would attract those hiring if I displayed those efforts where the right audience is looking.

In comes Instagram. I've irritated people by ranting and raving about how I think Instagram, Zuckerberg, and Mosseri are all evil, data-scraping, self-esteem-ruining entities. Because two things remain true:

1. Instagram is where all the normies are,
2. Instagram is where all the recruiters, hiring managers, art event organizers, and artist alley jurors are.

Those truths do not change based on whether or not the platform is *evilly,* let-me-stress, ***HEINOUSLY*** scraping casual or personal text, images, photos, art, pictures of children, whatever. They only change if the culture and accessible tools change subsequently, or at the same time. Typically, the tools change, but the culture doesn't shift, and Instagram remains king.

And as you may know, if you've kept your ears open to my barking, [I need a job](https://hikatamika.com/blog/20250927-shop-and-rewards/).  
Hell, when I get one, I might stop posting to Instagram ***again,*** but while I remain in a pinch, something-something 🤡it'd be foolish of me not to use every tool available to me—🤡 blah-blah-blah, yadda-yadda-yadda.
## Boundaries and Breadcrumbs…
Despite all that, God forbid I become a scroll-zombie like the masses, Noah-Fence.

I'm on my second digital detox, and let me say: with every one, I care about social media platforms (as apps) a sizable amount less (my heart's still with the communities though), and I fall in love with personal websites, and timelineless communication platforms (email, RSS, newsletters, instant messaging *sometimes*) more.

You've heard me talk about how [Posts are Like Farts in the Wind](https://hikatamika.com/blog/20251011-on-audience/). I still think that's true.  
I say this with love and fondness, but I know and expect you all to miss any and every post I make unless I self-reshare it every 5 seconds—and God forbid I succumb to the brainrot that is… doing that. I feel better the longer I run off into the metaphorical woods to cook, and it makes me come back to digital town squares with better art and writing to share. Even if only 5 people are chilling by the big ornate water fountain the very moment I show up to town with a canvas in tow.

I think my website, newsletter, and other off-platform means of contact are ways to have deeper interactions with me, and it helps me spend less Spirit-Investment into my efforts on platforms specifically. I still like investing Spirit into communities, which is why I feel like I'll always be a commenting and resharing guy, especially on the platforms I feel more comfortable with, but IDK, now I feel more confident and secure in not wasting a ton of effort on my profile itself.

The art and writing that I embed/link through it, _**yes,**_ I can and should put effort into those. But the profile itself, the growth, and the engagement, nah—why bother. Who cares. alskdjfhasf I'd rather someone thoroughly browse my website, ***once*** than get a milliionty-bajillionty followers on any platform.

To speak in metaphor, in my studio, I bake big, fluffy loaves of bread. On my website, I slice and serve it with the best toppings ever (strawberry jam… salted Kerrygold butter…), and we might chat over the nice meal via off-platform messaging.

And on Social media…

`*raspberry sound effect*`

I leave a breadcrumb trail. Most folks will scurry along, take the breadcrumb, and friggen leave, like: that's the culture. A quick pop of SocMed while they're stuck on the can. But the *keen* observer… might go from one crumb… to another… 'til they find themselves in my house (website), at the dinner table, where I am slicing freshly baked bread, and spreading yummy toppings on it, waiting to tell you all about the process.

*Maybe.*

***Ideally.***

High chance no one will care, but in the case no one does, at least there's no effort wasted on breadcrumbs compared to the canvases I used to size and compose with Instagram in mind ***from the start***, let alone the turbo-edited Reels and Toks I made only for people to swipe past on sight.

Social media (speaking about the profiles, not the connections and friendships) is not an archive, it's not my worth—it's just breadcrumbs, man. If I go back to posting on Instagram, forget follows, forget likes, forget growth, forget engagement.

Just publishing. Just throwing a line. Just breadcrumbs.

## Digital Business Cards for Friction-Resistant Recruiters
Like my friends tried to inform me of regarding LinkedIn: art directors, hiring managers, artist alley jurors, IRL art event organizers, and the like… seem to prefer Instagram: as a digital business card box of sorts. A platform that provides a form of identification, with an attached gallery, that they can use to Direct Message artists they're intrigued by.

Additionally, Meta's geo-sorting is a boon to those running zine fests, art markets, and workshops.  This remains true. These types, as a greater group, have not really migrated to Bluesky or anything else.

So like, ***FINEEEE I GUESS.*** Lmao.

Even though I'd just be shepherding those types to my Superior Email Inbox™ anyway, at least they can make the first poke on my shoulder using the platform that they're most comfortable with.

Using an Instagram profile a little more dryly, like a LinkedIn one, further frees me from engagement and self-worth hustles, because it only needs to be ready and updated enough for a contact or recruiter to look at. No need to find my peak-engagement-posting-time or whatever. I don't ***have*** to mess with Stories or Reels or Broadcast Channels or anything of the sort. Especially when YouTube and my RSS/newsletter exist just fine, out of style as they may be. Especially if all I really want… is a job.
## Avoiding the Phone-Scroll Zombie Bite
I'd confessed that [I'd started to hate scrolling lately](https://hikatamika.com/blog/20250802-burnout-on-the-timeline/). That's still true. Unravelling the hodgepodge of everyone-I-follow or everyone-in-my-interest-cluster's posts in a single-file line… is a drag!

I'd much rather beeline to their profiles and catch up like I'm binge-watching a season of TV. And that's what I do! Using my FollowDex, which I'll introduce to you later. I friggen… refuse to scroll Instagram normally. Yes, even with the Following feed. Scrolling is just plain inferior to single-account-catchups for me, and scrolling isn't the point of why I'm reconsidering Instagram anyway. But, at least with my FollowDex I'll be able to show some love to my IG-only and IG-maining friends.

Honestly, I think the ***best*** way for me to use these sites I'm not community-oriented about (IG, TikTok) would be to just Post-and-Ghost, deadass—as anti-Hika as that sounds. But, 100% Post-and-Ghosting wouldn't be the most friendly thing to do, so I'll be interacting via my FollowDex in limited amounts.

*On my computer. **In BROWSER.***

I don't hate the little black rectangle as much as one would think, but apps are like a poisoned sugar pill, in a way. Apps for websites lock you into whatever addictive, attention-trap, depression-inducing experiences the UI/UX designers at a social media platform's development company want you to have… and that's why I already browse places like even Bluesky only on my computer using browser extensions, user scripts, and user-styles to modify and craft my own experience of a web app. It might seem like overkill to you, but it's made major changes for me. Literally all web apps I use are subject to those changes now, haha, especially/even Insta and TikTok if I go back.

In case anyone asks if this also means I'll go back to `[insert XYZ app here]` too, Digital Minimalism and NoSurf have changed me a lot as a person…

I feel like most apps I crosspost to are redundant to Bluesky with regard to the purpose posting serves for me: forming new human connections and putting my posts where people *can* (ideally) find them. They also have redundancy to the purpose of the gallery on my website: "all my art in one pile". These other platforms are the same things, just with… less human connections and… fewer people finding my posts… so… my outlook on my usage of most additional platforms I *could* be using is pretty bleak. Heck, if it weren't for how normie and recruiter-core Insta is, I wouldn't even be writing this blog post right now.

Anyways, that leads to the final point:

## Scrape, Slop, Honeypot
It's been made clear to us a couple of times now that Meta intends to use all art and text on a profile that can be publicly accessed by its own scraper-bots… *…as fodder for its LLM (text genAI) and diffusion (image genAI) models.* This frustrates me because it's a truth, and a truth I can't escape from living both in the US (no GDPR here—missing my home country rn lol 😔✌️ 🇬🇧) and in a global culture that still values Insta. After all, nothing replaces it on both a technical and cultural level yet.

***CRANKS UP THE GLAZE & NIGHTSHADE SLIDERS TO MAXIMUM :)***  
On cropped photos, that is. I have no intention of posting full-ratio canvases of mine to Instagram, even glazed to the nines.

With one exception…

In college, for one class I had, for one of the projects we had to make digital art using a technique called [databending](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Databending)—tl;dr: glitch art using actual data corruption methods instead of funny filters that artificially replicate the effect.

{% photoset %}
  {% photosetRow %}
    {% photosetItem "/src/img/posts/20251024-ig-crawl-01.webp", "A photo of Min Yoongi from BTS performing on stage, glitched and databent." %}
  {% endphotosetRow %}
{% endphotoset %}

Yeah, if I post full canvas art, I'm databending it. _And **then**_ Glazing and Nightshading on top of that.

Because I'm stubborn. And annoying.  
And will be using it as a breadcrumb to further push people to set aside convenience and seek me and my art out in deeper and more optimal ways.

But yeah, I think that's all I think about it for now. Still rolling the thought over like a marble in my head. Don't get all excited and run to follow me on Instagram ahead of time. Especially if you're already a visitor of my website, follow my Bluesky account, or enjoy me as an art content-creator. ashdfklasd It'd be a waste of time—even if your gut instinct is "my scroll would be so much more fun with *you* on it!!". You'd only be getting cropped-or-glitched portfolio-presentable art on my Instagram anyway—not my full art journey or interactive personhood. Remember the thing about people missing posts from people they're following on the scroll, anyway? Yeah, there's that too.

Like on god, I'm warning ya. I might, potentially, not even follow back if I already feel satisfied following you a platform I actually enjoy.

Digital Minimalism, y'see! Don't add redundancy to your HikaTamika-enjoying experience, all because I'm getting job-desperate.

Ciao.
