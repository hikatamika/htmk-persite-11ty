My life is like, a trinary rn. At any point I am either:

1. Freelancing: allows for me to live supported by family without feeling like a burden.
2. Doing personal projects: not unsupported, but if it weren't for the freelancing, I would not be able to do them like this.
3. Self-caring: 🍽️🛌🚿🔁

There are 8.2bil people on earth, and thousands of them are people who are trying just as hard in the same endeavors that won't even cross your timeline.

This is also why I encourage people to browse recent-search sometimes. Truly get a sense of how many people are out there trying that don't get swept up and boosted by algorithms.
