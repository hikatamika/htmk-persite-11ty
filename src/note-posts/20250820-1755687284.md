I think what's gonna be a key part of weaning off of social media a bit more is like, when faced with:  

"I'm bored. What should I do now?"

*thinking up what I **actually** want to do/research/consume next* instead of scrolling a feed in search for an answer.

We scroll socMed in search of what to do/research/consume. There's a time for that, to make sure we're staying culturally fresh, butâ€¦ it's less often than how much we normally seek it out, I think.
