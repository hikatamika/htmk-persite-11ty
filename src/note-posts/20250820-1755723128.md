Bro I'm reaching my timeline despair event horizon. I don't want (to scroll) people's art on my timeline anymore.  
Heck, I don't even want people's art in my DMs either. I want people's art in an inbox. Be it RSS, or email.  

My patience for scrolling is running thin. I don't want to scroll anymore. I want to hop onto someone's website and click on the gallery tab and see what's changed since the last time I looked at it. ðŸ˜¶

I want to binge ***ONE PERSON'S*** art in ***ONE*** sitting. I don't want to be pulled in multiple directions on the TL or anywhere else anymoreâ€¦ I'm going nuts.  
Using RSS is like having cable and being able to choose the channel, but everyone only existing on socMed, and being pulled in 700 different directions by everyone you care about through that communications means, is like the remote being stolen by the algorithm monkey. Chrono, ***OR*** trending.
