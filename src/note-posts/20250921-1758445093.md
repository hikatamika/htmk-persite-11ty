I feel like I'm only(\*) wanted/needed on Bluesky for like, my feeds and my reskeets and stuff and it makes me sad, often. Though, I must admit!! It's a bit of my own doing. You present a persona, you provide a utility, and people subconcsciously box you into it.

I used to think TikTok was the effort-vortex because people don't like to tab out of it and follow links… _but I'm starting to think **every timeline/feed-based social media platform is like that now**_… It used to not be like that. People used to be willing and able to like, really pursue deeper engagement with netizens and their work, but now everyone just treats fellow netizens as seasoning and ingredients to make their feed more enjoyable and dopamine-y.

Out of feed, out of mind.
