Nobody will hear, or understand this, but I have to say it anyway.

The problem with social media now compared to when it was born, is that it has been engineered to be so plugged into dopamine addiction instead of conversational bonding.

Posters want dopamine from engagement, scrollers want dopamine from good-posts-among-meh-posts in their scrolls, but few people want to like, talk/bond on a deeper (but still appropriate given the context) level anymore.

It's just "\[can I have dopamine please\]" and "\[thanks for the dopamine, m8\]" interactions, now. And the behavior has spread off of The Actual Platforms™, too.  
Boo. Boo stinky.

The concept of the "Like™" and just wanting empty little reactions from people instead of actual conversations, has ruined social media. Remember when *good!deviantArt* used to say "don't forget to leave a comment!" when you'd try to fave-and-run?

We've forgotten that. Now we just want Like™s. And we want other people to ***make*** stuff that makes our brains shoot out Like™ chemicals. And after that? We want next to nothing to do with those posters. Out-of-scroll, out-of-mind.  
Terrible, truly.
