I've been happily drawing to myself and improving my skills, but as far as sharing things goes, I live in this weird mental state where a drawing is either a Postâ„¢, like composed and intended for consumption from the start, or, a smaller part of a finished product (zine, comic, shop item) etc.

So when I want to draw and it's not to any of these ends, IDK what I'm doing. Or at least, IDK what the point of uploading it is.

Trying to teach myself how to draw presentable concept art, cause I guess that's a cultural norm for the inbetween.
