Majority of my design clients are friends, but, it always feels nice when they enjoy and hype up the final deliverable. ðŸ¥¹

I wish I felt as confident as I do working for my peers, ***putting myself out there into the job market.***  
IDK if it's that I've wandered myself into a really tight niche that the industry at large can't appreciate, or what.
