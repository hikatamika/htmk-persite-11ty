Going like semi-scorched earth through my Bluesky post historyâ€”deleting posts that I think are of little value:

- Me yapping to myself
- Me reacting to things
- Me thinking/processing thoughts out loud

And, it's weird seeing the posts that really resonated with people, I'm like "huh, I wonder why they felt dat".
- - -
But going through is just giving me more "why did what I said and did resonate on Bluesky, but isn't resonating in these job apps, bruh."
